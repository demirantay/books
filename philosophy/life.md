Death

Not scared in the slightest. I've learned to look at things through "terminal eyes" while knowing this is *probably* what will take me out, barring a severe accident of some sort.

I do what I want mostly and other than my alcoholism getting worse, I can say that the thought of it truly no longer bothers me, not even a little bit.

I'm comfortable with the idea of death completely and entirely.

Our world is on fire, and I've had 34 wonderful years divided between watching it and experiencing the good parts of it.

Death is just the next chapter, that's all.

All I want to convey, without being an asshole, is this;

Before a terminal diagnosis of anything, people are naturally self preserving. They are terrified and will do almost anything to avoid death.

After you know for a fact that you will die, you have two choices; live in absolute dread, fear, and anxiety, or, embrace it and realize that every single person who has ever lived, dies.

I'm not religious at all, but hey, I wonder what those guys are up to.

If it's nothing, cool, how would I know, how would I care?

If there's something, cool. Be extra kind to others because you never know what they are going through as well.

I've done chemo twice and brain surgery twice. I won't do either one again.

Live, do your best, and be kind.

Everything else is gravy.
