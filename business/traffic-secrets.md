## Intro

### Foreword

- Unfortunately, too many people in business have taken the concept literally and have decided to run their businesses that way. They think if they build the best product or service, invent the best widget, create the best mastermind, or write the best book, the world will just find it. They think that as long as they build the best product or service, people will just show up to buy it. The reality is they won’t just come.
  
  Unless people know that you exist and you give them a compelling reason to come find you, they aren’t coming. Without good marketing, your ideas will just be that: good ideas. Imagine looking back when you’re 80 years old and feeling like you just dabbled with 20 different great ideas but never really made the impact you desired.

### Preface

- Traffic Secrets approaches traffic from a completely different direction than anyone has discussed before: less from the tactical, fly-by-night operations and more from the strategic, long-term model that will ensure a consistent flow of people into your funnels. The strategies inside of this book are evergreen and will never change as long as there are humans on this planet to sell to.

- Over the past decade and a half that I’ve been playing this game, I’ve survived (and even thrived) during dozens of Google slaps, the “death” of email marketing, algorithm changes, the rise and fall of tons of social networks, and the fragmentation of online media. The question begs to be asked: Why did we survive when so many other companies have failed?

  TWO REASONS WE SURVIVED WHEN OTHERS FAILED
  - We understand how to use funnels. With funnels, we can make 5–10 times as much money for each visitor who clicks on our ads, so we survive and thrive when costs go up.
  - We have mastered the strategy (not just the tactics) behind getting traffic, and these strategies work on all advertising platforms in the past, present, and future. If you master these strategies, then no slap or snap can affect the lifeblood of your company.
  
  There will be another storm soon, just like there was with Google. It’s happened time and time again, and we know that the greatest predictor of the future is the past.
  
  The tactics behind how to get someone to click on an ad and come to your website literally change daily. In fact, I know people whose full-time jobs are solely dedicated to keeping up to speed with the changes that Facebook makes to its algorithm and Ads Manager.
  
  Those who understand funnels will last much longer because they will make more money from each visitor who clicks on their ads, but this tactic will soon become obsolete. This process is how most people learn to get traffic to their websites and into their funnels, and that’s where the problem comes from. How are you supposed to build your foundation for your company on a slippery slope like that?
  
  The reason I am still here today is because when I started playing this game 15 years ago, there weren’t any traffic courses teaching the latest tactics. The people I studied with didn’t have the internet when they were growing their companies. The people I learned from were some of the old- school, direct response marketing greats like Dan Kennedy, Bill Glazer, Gary Halbert, Jay Abraham
  
  These guys didn’t have the luxury of Facebook or Google; they learned the strategies of driving traffic before there even was an internet! Instead, they drove traffic with direct mail, radio ads, TV, and newspapers. Moving forward, you have to understand that traffic is people, and people are extremely predictable. The core strategies that I’m going to teach you will outlast and supersede any particular platform, so you can apply them anywhere.
  
- THE BIG CHALLENGE

  Some of you may be shocked or offended that nowhere in this book—a book entirely about traffic—will you see a single image of the Facebook Ads editor or a detailed explanation showing you how to set up your Google Ads campaign. I didn’t put any platform-specific screenshots inside of this book because I wanted this work to remain evergreen for you. Instead, we will be focusing on strategies that don’t change, including:
  - Identifying your dream customers
  - Finding out where they are already congregating online
  - Learning how to “work” your way in
  - Understanding how to “buy” your way in
  - Creating your own publishing platform
  - Building your own distribution lists
  
  All these strategies have one big thing in common: when the storms come, the user interface changes, or the traffic moves, they will still work! They leverage the big media properties (such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram) when they are hot, but also when these platforms change, you can easily move to where the eyeballs go

## Your Dream Customer

- Isn’t that unbelievable? They could lock up an entrepreneur for eight years to teach them a skill, but not even spend 10 minutes showing them how to market that skill. To me, it’s the biggest problem with our education system. Some think, My product is so good, I don’t need to pay for traffic.

  Still others believe they’re entitled to customers because they feel they built a better product than their competitors. So they wait, all the while thinking, I built it. Why aren’t they coming? Yet after coaching hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs, I can tell you that the people who put all their focus on creating something amazing (instead of also focusing on getting people to actually see what they created) are the people that fail.
  
  Waiting for people to come to you is not a strategy. But understanding exactly who your dream customer is, discovering where they’re congregating, and throwing out hooks that will grab their attention to pull them into your funnels (where you can tell them a story and make them an offer) is the strategy. That’s the big secret.

### Who Is Your Dream Customer

- When they entered the new room, he saw a wall full of pictures of “Alexis,” a fictitious character who represented Sally Beauty Supply’s dream customer. The execs then went on to explain that everyone in the company was trained that when they make any decision about what products to purchase, what colors to use in the stores or their branding, what ads to run, what promotions to create, what their websites looked like, and what music to play in their locations, everything was run through the lens of Alexis’s eyes.

  If it was something that Alexis would love, then the answer was yes. If it wasn’t something she would love, then the answer was always no. They didn’t run a product-centric company; they ran a customer-centric company. Their customer avatar is what drove everything from the products they created to the ads that they ran.
  
  BECOMING OBSESSED WITH YOUR DREAM CUSTOMERS
  
  The first step in this process is to become obsessed with your dream customer. Companies that become obsessed with their products will eventually fail. I was recently talking to my friend Nicholas Bayerle about the fact that most businesses are created from a problem that an entrepreneur had, and their product or service was the result of them figuring out the solution to that problem. “Our mess becomes our message,”
  
  If that’s true, then you need to look back in time to find the point where you were struggling with the same problem your dream customer has now. Then you need to remember what you were feeling when you were in that pain.
  
  If you want to really understand who your dream customers are and where they are congregating online, you need to be able to enter the conversation that is already taking place inside of their mind and see the world the way that they see it. When you truly understand the core pains they are trying to move away from and the core desires and passions they are trying to move toward, it becomes very easy to identify exactly where they exist online.
  
  THE 3 CORE MARKETS/DESIRES
  
  The three desires (in no particular order) are health, wealth, and relationships. When people purchase any product from anyone, they’re hoping to get a certain result in one of these three areas of their lives. So the first question you need to answer is this: Which of these three desires is my future dream customer trying to receive when they buy my product or service?  However, sometimes people get stuck on this question for one of two reasons.
  
  Reason #1 — My product fits into more than one of these desires: Many products can be marketed toward getting a result in more than one of these desires, but your marketing message can only focus on one of them. Anytime you try to get your potential customer to believe in two things, your conversions will usually cut in half (most times by 90 percent or more). To target two different desires, you need two different ads leading to two different funnels. Only focus on one desire with each message you put into the market.
  
  Reason #2 — My product doesn’t fit into any of these desires: Most products can fit into multiple categories, even if they may look as if they don’t fit into any category at all, but no matter what, the key is that your marketing message can and must be focused on only one of the 3 Core Desires.
  
  AWAY FROM PAIN/TOWARD PLEASURE
  
  Every human being on this planet is always moving in one of two directions when they make a decision: away from pain or toward pleasure. Moving Away from Pain: The first direction that people can be moving in is away from pain. Let me show you a few examples of moving away from pain for each desire.
  
  Health (moving away from pain) -- I’m overweight and don’t feel comfortable in my clothes., I hate what I see when I look into the mirror.
  
  Wealth (moving away from pain) -- I hate my job and want to fire my boss., 
I have no money saved, and I’m scared I could lose my job.

  Relationships (moving away from pain) -- I’m in a bad relationship and don’t know how to get out., I feel alone and want to feel what love feels like.
  
  I did three things to try to understand the conversation that they were having with themselves each day, 
  - 1. I wrote out hundreds of phrases that I used to say to myself when I was trying to solve the problem for myself
  - 2. I looked online in forums, message boards, and groups to see what others are saying when they are trying to get out of pain.
  - 3. I really tried to put myself in their shoes and wrote out what I believed people were thinking.
  
  Moving Toward Pleasure: They don’t have a desire for health, wealth, or relationships because they are unhappy; they have a desire because they are happy and looking for more.
  
  Health (moving toward pleasure) -- I want to get six-pack abs.
  
  Wealth (moving toward pleasure) -- I want to buy my dream house or dream car., I want to grow my company so I can have more impact.
  
  Relationships (moving toward pleasure) -- I want more passion in my relationships., I want to spend more time with my spouse and kids.
  
  while everyone may be trying to accomplish the same goal, the reasons why they’re doing it are almost polar opposites. The more phrases you can find, the more traffic streams you’ll be able to tap into, so make it a continual process to identify and write down the conversations happening inside of your customers’ minds.
  
- THE SEARCHER AND THE SCROLLER

  No longer would people only buy when they needed something; now advertisers had the ability to create desire and sell people stuff that they wanted. This interruption advertising started happening in other types of media such as radio, newspapers, and direct mail. The process was simple: get a captive audience, entertain or educate them, and then, when you have their full attention, interrupt them with your message. You can then grab their attention and create desire for the product or service that you are selling.
  
  It’s interesting to note that when the internet started a few decades ago, it followed a very similar pattern. It began with searches. People had some type of need, usually to get out of some type of pain, and they would immediately go to the search engines looking for a solution to their problems. Later we were all introduced to social media through platforms including Myspace, Facebook, and Instagram; and just like the Bulova ad in 1941, in 2007 Facebook announced the first-ever social interruption advertising with Facebook Ads. People would be online talking to their friends, posting pictures, liking images and videos, and then suddenly, your ad would show up in their Facebook feed. You’d have a small window of time to grab their attention, create a desire for your product or service, and make a special offer.

### Where Are They Hiding

- WHAT!?! Was he crazy? There was no way that Cael would lose to Bruce ... That’s when it hit me. TheMat.com was our little corner of the internet. All the wrestlers in study hall were congregated on that website talking about wrestling, but we weren’t the only ones. Wrestlers in other colleges across the country, along with high school wrestlers and their parents, were on the website too. All around the world, hundreds of thousands of people were all together in this one spot to talk about the topic that we loved most: wrestling.
  
  Honestly, that is the real power of the internet: it has allowed us to connect with like-minded people in a way that wasn’t possible before. It’s allowed each of us, with our unique and sometimes weird hobbies and interests, to congregate with our people to discuss the things that mean the most to us.
  
  Magic: The Gathering. Before the internet, groups like this were limited in size to how many people they could find that had the same interests and were located geographically near them.
  
  Here are some questions you should be asking yourself at this point:
  - What are the top websites that my dream customers already go to?
  - What forums or message boards do they participate in?
  - What are the Facebook groups they engage in?
  - Who are the influencers they follow on Facebook and Instagram?
  - What podcasts do they listen to?
  - What are the email newsletters they are subscribed to?
  - What blogs do they read?
  - What channels are they following on YouTube?
  - What keywords are they searching for in Google to find information?
  
  These questions will help you to start identifying where your dream customers are hiding. The answers to these questions should be simple, especially if you are your dream customer.
  
- THE DREAM 100 (ONE TO ONE)

  Then one day Chet had an idea. He did some research and discovered that out of those 2,000 advertisers, 167 of them were spending 95 percent of their advertising budgets with his competitors. So he defined those 167 spending all the money in the industry as his best buyers. Then he stopped marketing to everybody else and focused his time and efforts on those 167 advertisers. His strategy included sending out direct mail pieces with lumpy objects in them every two weeks, where he followed up on each package with a phone call. Twice a month he’d mail a package, and twice a month he’d call.

  Then, in his fourth month, something changed. He landed his first big account: Xerox. It was the biggest advertising buy ever for the company. By the sixth month, he had landed 28 of the 167 advertisers. And with those 28 advertisers, Chet doubled the sales over the previous year and went from number 15 in the industry to number 1.
  
  Chet said, “The goal of the Dream 100 is to take your ideal buyers from ‘I’ve never heard of this company’ to ‘What is this company I keep hearing about?’ to ‘I think I’ve heard of that company’ to ‘Yes, I’ve heard of that company’ to ‘Yes, I do business with that company.’”
  
  THE DREAM 100 (ONE TO MANY)
  
  Chet Holmes’s Dream 100 for “One to One” selling strategy is powerful when your business model needs a small number of big customers. But for most of us, we’re looking for lots of customers, not just 100. When I was starting out, many of the things I sold weren’t very expensive, so it didn’t make financial sense to send packages and make phone calls to try to sell a $20 product. That’s why Chet’s Dream 100 concept didn’t make sense when I first heard it; I couldn’t see how it applied to my online business.
  
  I made a list and wrote out everywhere that I could think my dream customers might be gathering. On that list I identified:
  - 10+ top websites and forums they spent time on
  - 15+ active Facebook groups they participated in
  - 50+ influencers they followed on Facebook and Instagram
  - 30+ podcasts they listened to
  - 40+ email newsletters they subscribed to
  - 20+ blogs that they actively read
  - 20+ YouTube channels they subscribed to
  
  After making the list, I added up how many subscribers, readers, and followers each of those channels had. I was so excited to find out that there were over 30 million of my dream customers on that little list alone, all congregated inside of those 185-plus communities!
  
  I brainstormed ideas, and that’s when the bolt of lightning hit! The Dream 100!

  The second part of the Dream 100 strategy (covered in more detail in Secret #4) works even for those who didn’t respond or weren’t willing to promote my book. Advertising platforms like Facebook allow you to target your ads to people with certain interests. For example, Tony Robbins was in my Dream 100, and while he didn’t directly promote my first book,
  
  I still wanted to market to his (at the time) 3.2 million-person audience, as they were my dream customers too. On Facebook, I was able to buy ads that were only shown to his audience, and we were able to sell thousands of copies of my book to his people!
  
  Our launch campaign for my book may have seemed massive from the outside as we sold over 100,000 copies in a very short period of time, but in reality, we just put a concentrated effort to market to the dream customers of 185 people.
  
  Russell, this may work for you and Rachel when you’re selling books, but I sell something different, so the Dream 100 can’t work for me. It always makes me laugh when people think these concepts will work for every business except their own, when the reality is that this concept works for every business. Period
  
  When people are building a community, they have a real sense of service to that community. We would send them free product and just say, “If you like it, tell people, and if you hate it, tell people that too.” Not trying to steer people’s comments gave us a pretty great recommendation.

- A DIFFERENT DREAM 100 ON EACH PLATFORM

  “We can spend a ton of time and money convincing people on these other platforms to move to podcasts, or we can spend that same time and money focusing on the people who are already listening to podcasts. If they find a new show they love, they’ll listen every day!”
  
  That was the big “aha” that set into motion our strategy for building a special Dream 100 list just for our podcast through the other podcasts that our dream listeners were listening to. It also caused us to build out Dream 100 lists for every platform we’ve talked about already.
  
  You see, prior to this big “aha,” we only had one big collective Dream 100 list with people from all the platforms. We hadn’t respected the fact that people like to consume media in their own favorite ways, and while it’s possible to move people from one platform to another, there is much less resistance when you just migrate people to you who are already on the platform that they love.
  
  WHAT ABOUT “BRICK-AND-MORTAR”-TYPE BUSINESSES?
  
  At this point, some of you may be thinking, But Russell, I’m not selling a book or a product online. I’m a local brick-and- mortar business trying to generate local leads online, so this won’t work for me. For all my brick-and-mortar business owners, don’t worry, this strategy still works, even though you will need to look at it a little differently. When building your Dream 100 list, instead of identifying the national influencers or leaders in your niche, you need to identify your local influencers.
  
  For example, if I owned a local juice bar, I would ask myself: Who is my dream customer and where are they already congregating? My dream customer would be someone who is trying to get healthier. To find these dream customers, I would create a list of the local gyms, health food stores, chiropractors, personal trainers, nutritionists, etc., and then start building my Dream 100 from that list.

- CREATING YOUR DREAM 100 LIST

  Everything we do from this point forward from paid ads to free traffic to joint ventures will all build from this core foundation of the Dream 100. Yes, it’s simple, but it’s the foundation to everything!
  
  At ClickFunnels, we don’t just leverage the Dream 100 approach for traffic ... we use it for EVERYTHING. How do we pick the market we want to enter? We use the Dream 100 to research different markets and niches, then we narrow in on the ones that suit us best. How do we decide on our blue-ocean strategy? We use the Dream 100 to find the red oceans and carve out our place in the market. How do we create our offers and figure out what’s going to sell? We use the Dream 100 to model offers that are working in our marketplace, which takes out the headache and hassle of “blind guessing.”

  THE TWO CORE TYPES OF CONGREGATIONS
  
  Interest-Based Congregations: The first type of congregation is based on interests. In most social networks, after someone joins, the first thing the network tries to do is figure out what things you’re interested in. Facebook is believed to automatically track over 52,000 data points on each user as they are using their platform, which is super annoying as a user but super awesome for us as advertisers.
  
  Search-Based Congregations: When someone goes to Google or any other search platform, they type in a keyword phrase looking for something like: how to lose weight, emergency plumber Boise Idaho, best water filters . As soon as they type a phrase, they enter an existing congregation of people searching for the same thing.
  
  This type of congregation is called a search-based congregation, and searches can occur on Google, Yahoo, or any other search platform. Some popular search platforms at the time of this writing are Quora.com, where people can ask questions on any topic; Pinterest.com, where people search for images; and YouTube.com, where people search for almost everything!
  
- WHERE DO I START?

  At the end of the day, traffic is a numbers game. I want to find 100 (or more) people because even with 100 people, we may only get 5 to 10 of them who are willing to let us get in front of their audience for free. After that, we may only get 10 or so others for whom we’re able to successfully target their audiences on the ad networks, so it’s essential that you cast a wide net. Each of the three markets have an unlimited number of submarkets. For example:
  - Wealth → finance, investing, real estate, sales, marketing
  - Health → nutrition, strength training, weight loss
  - Relationships → marriage advice, dating advice, love
  
  So, for example, if my market is wealth: Wealth → marketing → sales funnels

  With that in mind, when I build my Dream 100, I’m not just looking for other people who are selling “sales funnels” stuff. I do add those people, companies, and keywords to my list, but what I’m really looking for is all the other people, companies, and keywords that are within my submarket. They are my warmest traffic and where I focus first.
  
  My goal is to provide my Dream 100’s followers with my new opportunity. I can usually build my Dream 100 from this list pretty easily. But if you’re struggling to identify all the niches within your submarket, just ask yourself this question: What other vehicles are people trying to use to (insert result they desire) with (insert your submarket here)?
  
  In the WEALTH core market with a real estate submarket, I’d ask: “What other vehicles are people trying to use to make money inside the real estate submarket?” The answers to these questions would include: house flipping, short sales, and wholesaling.
  
  In the HEALTH core market with a weight-loss submarket, I’d ask: “What other vehicles are people trying to use to get six-pack abs inside the weight loss submarket?” The answers to these questions would include: Keto diet, vegan diet, meatatarian diet, and bodybuilding.
  
  In the RELATIONSHIPS core market with a parenting submarket, I’d ask: “What other vehicles are people trying to use to have a better relationship with their kids inside the parenting submarket?” The answers to these questions would include: homeschooling, baby sign language, after-school sporting programs, and drama.
  
  Each of these answers is a niche within a submarket with dozens of influencers, companies, and keywords that you can target! Your submarket is where you should focus all of your Dream 100 efforts initially because this is your warmest traffic.

### Hook, Story, Offer, and The Attractive Character

- The framework that Natalie used to get over 120,000 people to buy her book Abs, Core, and Pelvic Floor is called Hook, Story, Offer.

  The hook is the image and the headline that Jessica saw as she was scrolling through her feed. It hooked her and stopped her just long enough to get her attention. It then asked Jessica to click on a link, which gave Natalie a moment to tell her story, build a relationship with Jessica, and explain the perceived value of the offer she would be making. Finally, Natalie made her an irresistible offer that would help Jessica to get out of pain and move toward pleasure. This Hook, Story, Offer framework is the pattern that you’ll see over and over again in most ads and funnels online.
  
  HOOK, STORY, OFFER
  
  It’s the core foundation for how we sell anything online. It’s how we diagnose what’s not working in every funnel that we set up. If an ad isn’t working, it’s always because of the hook, the story, or the offer. If a funnel isn’t converting, it’s always because of the hook, the story, or the offer. It really is that simple and probably the most important framework that I am teaching you to master.
  
  Hook: Now that we know exactly where our dream customers are congregating, our job is to throw hooks to them to see if we can grab their attention. The hook is the thing that grabs someone’s attention so you can tell them a story. You see thousands of hooks every day. Every email subject line is a hook, trying to grab your attention for just a moment so you’ll read that email. Every post, picture, and video you see in your feed on Facebook is a hook that is trying to get you to engage so they can tell you a story and then make you an offer. Every picture on Instagram, thumbnail on YouTube, and headline on a blog is a hook designed to grab your attention. 
  
  Anything that grabs someone’s attention is a hook, and the better you get at creating it and throwing it into your Dream 100’s congregations, the more attention you will get. What hooks can I throw out that will cause them to stop scrolling and listen long enough to hear my story? Pay attention the next time you’re scrolling to what hooks grab your attention. Why did you stop? Why did you click play? What did the hook say, and how did it make you feel? Answering these questions will help you to become amazing at developing hooks.

  Story: After the hook grabs their attention, you now have a small window to connect with them through story. There are two core goals from that story that you are about to tell them.
  - The story will increase the value of the offer that you are about to make. By telling the right story (or “epiphany bridge” stories, mentioned in Expert Secrets), you can show the perceived value of what you’re selling and the story will create a desire for them to buy now.
  - The story will build a connection with you as the Attractive Character and your brand. Even if someone doesn’t buy something today, if they connect with you, they will become your follower, and then your customer, and eventually your raving fan. Your stories will help them to build a relationship with your brand.
 
  Offer: The hook gets your customers’ attention, the story creates desire, and the last step of every message, post, email, and video is the offer. The offer doesn’t always mean asking people to buy something amazing, although this is my favorite type of offer. The offer could be as small as telling them if they “like this post” or “comment on my video” or “subscribe to my podcast” or “join my list,” you’ll give them a special thing in exchange. The better the offer is, the more likely someone is to do the thing that you actually want them to do. If people aren’t doing what you want them to do (joining your list, clicking your ads, or buying your stuff), the simplest way to fix it is often to increase the offer.
  
  The same thing is true with your ads. If you hook someone, tell them a story, and make them an offer and they still don’t buy, it’s likely that the offer isn’t good enough for them. You may need to tell a better story to increase the perceived value of the offer, or maybe you may need to make a better offer. Add more bonuses, increase how much they get, make it sexier
  
  If any of your traffic campaigns aren’t working, it’s always the hook, the story, or the offer. And if you want to solve all these problems, create better hooks, tell better stories, and make better offers.
