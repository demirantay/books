## Intro

### Foreword

- Unfortunately, too many people in business have taken the concept literally and have decided to run their businesses that way. They think if they build the best product or service, invent the best widget, create the best mastermind, or write the best book, the world will just find it. They think that as long as they build the best product or service, people will just show up to buy it. The reality is they won’t just come.
  
  Unless people know that you exist and you give them a compelling reason to come find you, they aren’t coming. Without good marketing, your ideas will just be that: good ideas. Imagine looking back when you’re 80 years old and feeling like you just dabbled with 20 different great ideas but never really made the impact you desired.

### Preface

- Traffic Secrets approaches traffic from a completely different direction than anyone has discussed before: less from the tactical, fly-by-night operations and more from the strategic, long-term model that will ensure a consistent flow of people into your funnels. The strategies inside of this book are evergreen and will never change as long as there are humans on this planet to sell to.

- Over the past decade and a half that I’ve been playing this game, I’ve survived (and even thrived) during dozens of Google slaps, the “death” of email marketing, algorithm changes, the rise and fall of tons of social networks, and the fragmentation of online media. The question begs to be asked: Why did we survive when so many other companies have failed?

  TWO REASONS WE SURVIVED WHEN OTHERS FAILED
  - We understand how to use funnels. With funnels, we can make 5–10 times as much money for each visitor who clicks on our ads, so we survive and thrive when costs go up.
  - We have mastered the strategy (not just the tactics) behind getting traffic, and these strategies work on all advertising platforms in the past, present, and future. If you master these strategies, then no slap or snap can affect the lifeblood of your company.
  
  There will be another storm soon, just like there was with Google. It’s happened time and time again, and we know that the greatest predictor of the future is the past.
  
  The tactics behind how to get someone to click on an ad and come to your website literally change daily. In fact, I know people whose full-time jobs are solely dedicated to keeping up to speed with the changes that Facebook makes to its algorithm and Ads Manager.
  
  Those who understand funnels will last much longer because they will make more money from each visitor who clicks on their ads, but this tactic will soon become obsolete. This process is how most people learn to get traffic to their websites and into their funnels, and that’s where the problem comes from. How are you supposed to build your foundation for your company on a slippery slope like that?
  
  The reason I am still here today is because when I started playing this game 15 years ago, there weren’t any traffic courses teaching the latest tactics. The people I studied with didn’t have the internet when they were growing their companies. The people I learned from were some of the old- school, direct response marketing greats like Dan Kennedy, Bill Glazer, Gary Halbert, Jay Abraham
  
  These guys didn’t have the luxury of Facebook or Google; they learned the strategies of driving traffic before there even was an internet! Instead, they drove traffic with direct mail, radio ads, TV, and newspapers. Moving forward, you have to understand that traffic is people, and people are extremely predictable. The core strategies that I’m going to teach you will outlast and supersede any particular platform, so you can apply them anywhere.
  
- THE BIG CHALLENGE

  Some of you may be shocked or offended that nowhere in this book—a book entirely about traffic—will you see a single image of the Facebook Ads editor or a detailed explanation showing you how to set up your Google Ads campaign. I didn’t put any platform-specific screenshots inside of this book because I wanted this work to remain evergreen for you. Instead, we will be focusing on strategies that don’t change, including:
  - Identifying your dream customers
  - Finding out where they are already congregating online
  - Learning how to “work” your way in
  - Understanding how to “buy” your way in
  - Creating your own publishing platform
  - Building your own distribution lists
  
  All these strategies have one big thing in common: when the storms come, the user interface changes, or the traffic moves, they will still work! They leverage the big media properties (such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram) when they are hot, but also when these platforms change, you can easily move to where the eyeballs go

## Your Dream Customer

- Isn’t that unbelievable? They could lock up an entrepreneur for eight years to teach them a skill, but not even spend 10 minutes showing them how to market that skill. To me, it’s the biggest problem with our education system. Some think, My product is so good, I don’t need to pay for traffic.

  Still others believe they’re entitled to customers because they feel they built a better product than their competitors. So they wait, all the while thinking, I built it. Why aren’t they coming? Yet after coaching hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs, I can tell you that the people who put all their focus on creating something amazing (instead of also focusing on getting people to actually see what they created) are the people that fail.
  
  Waiting for people to come to you is not a strategy. But understanding exactly who your dream customer is, discovering where they’re congregating, and throwing out hooks that will grab their attention to pull them into your funnels (where you can tell them a story and make them an offer) is the strategy. That’s the big secret.

### Who Is Your Dream Customer

- When they entered the new room, he saw a wall full of pictures of “Alexis,” a fictitious character who represented Sally Beauty Supply’s dream customer. The execs then went on to explain that everyone in the company was trained that when they make any decision about what products to purchase, what colors to use in the stores or their branding, what ads to run, what promotions to create, what their websites looked like, and what music to play in their locations, everything was run through the lens of Alexis’s eyes.

  If it was something that Alexis would love, then the answer was yes. If it wasn’t something she would love, then the answer was always no. They didn’t run a product-centric company; they ran a customer-centric company. Their customer avatar is what drove everything from the products they created to the ads that they ran.
  
  BECOMING OBSESSED WITH YOUR DREAM CUSTOMERS
  
  The first step in this process is to become obsessed with your dream customer. Companies that become obsessed with their products will eventually fail. I was recently talking to my friend Nicholas Bayerle about the fact that most businesses are created from a problem that an entrepreneur had, and their product or service was the result of them figuring out the solution to that problem. “Our mess becomes our message,”
  
  If that’s true, then you need to look back in time to find the point where you were struggling with the same problem your dream customer has now. Then you need to remember what you were feeling when you were in that pain.
  
  If you want to really understand who your dream customers are and where they are congregating online, you need to be able to enter the conversation that is already taking place inside of their mind and see the world the way that they see it. When you truly understand the core pains they are trying to move away from and the core desires and passions they are trying to move toward, it becomes very easy to identify exactly where they exist online.
  
  THE 3 CORE MARKETS/DESIRES
  
  The three desires (in no particular order) are health, wealth, and relationships. When people purchase any product from anyone, they’re hoping to get a certain result in one of these three areas of their lives. So the first question you need to answer is this: Which of these three desires is my future dream customer trying to receive when they buy my product or service?  However, sometimes people get stuck on this question for one of two reasons.
  
  Reason #1 — My product fits into more than one of these desires: Many products can be marketed toward getting a result in more than one of these desires, but your marketing message can only focus on one of them. Anytime you try to get your potential customer to believe in two things, your conversions will usually cut in half (most times by 90 percent or more). To target two different desires, you need two different ads leading to two different funnels. Only focus on one desire with each message you put into the market.
  
  Reason #2 — My product doesn’t fit into any of these desires: Most products can fit into multiple categories, even if they may look as if they don’t fit into any category at all, but no matter what, the key is that your marketing message can and must be focused on only one of the 3 Core Desires.
  
  AWAY FROM PAIN/TOWARD PLEASURE
  
  Every human being on this planet is always moving in one of two directions when they make a decision: away from pain or toward pleasure. Moving Away from Pain: The first direction that people can be moving in is away from pain. Let me show you a few examples of moving away from pain for each desire.
  
  Health (moving away from pain) -- I’m overweight and don’t feel comfortable in my clothes., I hate what I see when I look into the mirror.
  
  Wealth (moving away from pain) -- I hate my job and want to fire my boss., 
I have no money saved, and I’m scared I could lose my job.

  Relationships (moving away from pain) -- I’m in a bad relationship and don’t know how to get out., I feel alone and want to feel what love feels like.
  
  I did three things to try to understand the conversation that they were having with themselves each day, 
  - 1. I wrote out hundreds of phrases that I used to say to myself when I was trying to solve the problem for myself
  - 2. I looked online in forums, message boards, and groups to see what others are saying when they are trying to get out of pain.
  - 3. I really tried to put myself in their shoes and wrote out what I believed people were thinking.
  
  Moving Toward Pleasure: They don’t have a desire for health, wealth, or relationships because they are unhappy; they have a desire because they are happy and looking for more.
  
  Health (moving toward pleasure) -- I want to get six-pack abs.
  
  Wealth (moving toward pleasure) -- I want to buy my dream house or dream car., I want to grow my company so I can have more impact.
  
  Relationships (moving toward pleasure) -- I want more passion in my relationships., I want to spend more time with my spouse and kids.
  
  while everyone may be trying to accomplish the same goal, the reasons why they’re doing it are almost polar opposites. The more phrases you can find, the more traffic streams you’ll be able to tap into, so make it a continual process to identify and write down the conversations happening inside of your customers’ minds.
  
- THE SEARCHER AND THE SCROLLER

  No longer would people only buy when they needed something; now advertisers had the ability to create desire and sell people stuff that they wanted. This interruption advertising started happening in other types of media such as radio, newspapers, and direct mail. The process was simple: get a captive audience, entertain or educate them, and then, when you have their full attention, interrupt them with your message. You can then grab their attention and create desire for the product or service that you are selling.
  
  It’s interesting to note that when the internet started a few decades ago, it followed a very similar pattern. It began with searches. People had some type of need, usually to get out of some type of pain, and they would immediately go to the search engines looking for a solution to their problems. Later we were all introduced to social media through platforms including Myspace, Facebook, and Instagram; and just like the Bulova ad in 1941, in 2007 Facebook announced the first-ever social interruption advertising with Facebook Ads. People would be online talking to their friends, posting pictures, liking images and videos, and then suddenly, your ad would show up in their Facebook feed. You’d have a small window of time to grab their attention, create a desire for your product or service, and make a special offer.

### Where Are They Hiding

- WHAT!?! Was he crazy? There was no way that Cael would lose to Bruce ... That’s when it hit me. TheMat.com was our little corner of the internet. All the wrestlers in study hall were congregated on that website talking about wrestling, but we weren’t the only ones. Wrestlers in other colleges across the country, along with high school wrestlers and their parents, were on the website too. All around the world, hundreds of thousands of people were all together in this one spot to talk about the topic that we loved most: wrestling.
  
  Honestly, that is the real power of the internet: it has allowed us to connect with like-minded people in a way that wasn’t possible before. It’s allowed each of us, with our unique and sometimes weird hobbies and interests, to congregate with our people to discuss the things that mean the most to us.
  
  Magic: The Gathering. Before the internet, groups like this were limited in size to how many people they could find that had the same interests and were located geographically near them.
  
  Here are some questions you should be asking yourself at this point:
  - What are the top websites that my dream customers already go to?
  - What forums or message boards do they participate in?
  - What are the Facebook groups they engage in?
  - Who are the influencers they follow on Facebook and Instagram?
  - What podcasts do they listen to?
  - What are the email newsletters they are subscribed to?
  - What blogs do they read?
  - What channels are they following on YouTube?
  - What keywords are they searching for in Google to find information?
  
  These questions will help you to start identifying where your dream customers are hiding. The answers to these questions should be simple, especially if you are your dream customer.
  
- THE DREAM 100 (ONE TO ONE)

  Then one day Chet had an idea. He did some research and discovered that out of those 2,000 advertisers, 167 of them were spending 95 percent of their advertising budgets with his competitors. So he defined those 167 spending all the money in the industry as his best buyers. Then he stopped marketing to everybody else and focused his time and efforts on those 167 advertisers. His strategy included sending out direct mail pieces with lumpy objects in them every two weeks, where he followed up on each package with a phone call. Twice a month he’d mail a package, and twice a month he’d call.

  Then, in his fourth month, something changed. He landed his first big account: Xerox. It was the biggest advertising buy ever for the company. By the sixth month, he had landed 28 of the 167 advertisers. And with those 28 advertisers, Chet doubled the sales over the previous year and went from number 15 in the industry to number 1.
  
  Chet said, “The goal of the Dream 100 is to take your ideal buyers from ‘I’ve never heard of this company’ to ‘What is this company I keep hearing about?’ to ‘I think I’ve heard of that company’ to ‘Yes, I’ve heard of that company’ to ‘Yes, I do business with that company.’”
  
  THE DREAM 100 (ONE TO MANY)
  
  Chet Holmes’s Dream 100 for “One to One” selling strategy is powerful when your business model needs a small number of big customers. But for most of us, we’re looking for lots of customers, not just 100. When I was starting out, many of the things I sold weren’t very expensive, so it didn’t make financial sense to send packages and make phone calls to try to sell a $20 product. That’s why Chet’s Dream 100 concept didn’t make sense when I first heard it; I couldn’t see how it applied to my online business.
  
  I made a list and wrote out everywhere that I could think my dream customers might be gathering. On that list I identified:
  - 10+ top websites and forums they spent time on
  - 15+ active Facebook groups they participated in
  - 50+ influencers they followed on Facebook and Instagram
  - 30+ podcasts they listened to
  - 40+ email newsletters they subscribed to
  - 20+ blogs that they actively read
  - 20+ YouTube channels they subscribed to
  
  After making the list, I added up how many subscribers, readers, and followers each of those channels had. I was so excited to find out that there were over 30 million of my dream customers on that little list alone, all congregated inside of those 185-plus communities!
  
  I brainstormed ideas, and that’s when the bolt of lightning hit! The Dream 100!

  The second part of the Dream 100 strategy (covered in more detail in Secret #4) works even for those who didn’t respond or weren’t willing to promote my book. Advertising platforms like Facebook allow you to target your ads to people with certain interests. For example, Tony Robbins was in my Dream 100, and while he didn’t directly promote my first book,
  
  I still wanted to market to his (at the time) 3.2 million-person audience, as they were my dream customers too. On Facebook, I was able to buy ads that were only shown to his audience, and we were able to sell thousands of copies of my book to his people!
  
  Our launch campaign for my book may have seemed massive from the outside as we sold over 100,000 copies in a very short period of time, but in reality, we just put a concentrated effort to market to the dream customers of 185 people.
  
  Russell, this may work for you and Rachel when you’re selling books, but I sell something different, so the Dream 100 can’t work for me. It always makes me laugh when people think these concepts will work for every business except their own, when the reality is that this concept works for every business. Period
  
  When people are building a community, they have a real sense of service to that community. We would send them free product and just say, “If you like it, tell people, and if you hate it, tell people that too.” Not trying to steer people’s comments gave us a pretty great recommendation.

- A DIFFERENT DREAM 100 ON EACH PLATFORM

  “We can spend a ton of time and money convincing people on these other platforms to move to podcasts, or we can spend that same time and money focusing on the people who are already listening to podcasts. If they find a new show they love, they’ll listen every day!”
  
  That was the big “aha” that set into motion our strategy for building a special Dream 100 list just for our podcast through the other podcasts that our dream listeners were listening to. It also caused us to build out Dream 100 lists for every platform we’ve talked about already.
  
  You see, prior to this big “aha,” we only had one big collective Dream 100 list with people from all the platforms. We hadn’t respected the fact that people like to consume media in their own favorite ways, and while it’s possible to move people from one platform to another, there is much less resistance when you just migrate people to you who are already on the platform that they love.
  
  WHAT ABOUT “BRICK-AND-MORTAR”-TYPE BUSINESSES?
  
  At this point, some of you may be thinking, But Russell, I’m not selling a book or a product online. I’m a local brick-and- mortar business trying to generate local leads online, so this won’t work for me. For all my brick-and-mortar business owners, don’t worry, this strategy still works, even though you will need to look at it a little differently. When building your Dream 100 list, instead of identifying the national influencers or leaders in your niche, you need to identify your local influencers.
  
  For example, if I owned a local juice bar, I would ask myself: Who is my dream customer and where are they already congregating? My dream customer would be someone who is trying to get healthier. To find these dream customers, I would create a list of the local gyms, health food stores, chiropractors, personal trainers, nutritionists, etc., and then start building my Dream 100 from that list.

- CREATING YOUR DREAM 100 LIST

  Everything we do from this point forward from paid ads to free traffic to joint ventures will all build from this core foundation of the Dream 100. Yes, it’s simple, but it’s the foundation to everything!
  
  At ClickFunnels, we don’t just leverage the Dream 100 approach for traffic ... we use it for EVERYTHING. How do we pick the market we want to enter? We use the Dream 100 to research different markets and niches, then we narrow in on the ones that suit us best. How do we decide on our blue-ocean strategy? We use the Dream 100 to find the red oceans and carve out our place in the market. How do we create our offers and figure out what’s going to sell? We use the Dream 100 to model offers that are working in our marketplace, which takes out the headache and hassle of “blind guessing.”

  THE TWO CORE TYPES OF CONGREGATIONS
  
  Interest-Based Congregations: The first type of congregation is based on interests. In most social networks, after someone joins, the first thing the network tries to do is figure out what things you’re interested in. Facebook is believed to automatically track over 52,000 data points on each user as they are using their platform, which is super annoying as a user but super awesome for us as advertisers.
  
  Search-Based Congregations: When someone goes to Google or any other search platform, they type in a keyword phrase looking for something like: how to lose weight, emergency plumber Boise Idaho, best water filters . As soon as they type a phrase, they enter an existing congregation of people searching for the same thing.
  
  This type of congregation is called a search-based congregation, and searches can occur on Google, Yahoo, or any other search platform. Some popular search platforms at the time of this writing are Quora.com, where people can ask questions on any topic; Pinterest.com, where people search for images; and YouTube.com, where people search for almost everything!
  
- WHERE DO I START?

  At the end of the day, traffic is a numbers game. I want to find 100 (or more) people because even with 100 people, we may only get 5 to 10 of them who are willing to let us get in front of their audience for free. After that, we may only get 10 or so others for whom we’re able to successfully target their audiences on the ad networks, so it’s essential that you cast a wide net. Each of the three markets have an unlimited number of submarkets. For example:
  - Wealth → finance, investing, real estate, sales, marketing
  - Health → nutrition, strength training, weight loss
  - Relationships → marriage advice, dating advice, love
  
  So, for example, if my market is wealth: Wealth → marketing → sales funnels

  With that in mind, when I build my Dream 100, I’m not just looking for other people who are selling “sales funnels” stuff. I do add those people, companies, and keywords to my list, but what I’m really looking for is all the other people, companies, and keywords that are within my submarket. They are my warmest traffic and where I focus first.
  
  My goal is to provide my Dream 100’s followers with my new opportunity. I can usually build my Dream 100 from this list pretty easily. But if you’re struggling to identify all the niches within your submarket, just ask yourself this question: What other vehicles are people trying to use to (insert result they desire) with (insert your submarket here)?
  
  In the WEALTH core market with a real estate submarket, I’d ask: “What other vehicles are people trying to use to make money inside the real estate submarket?” The answers to these questions would include: house flipping, short sales, and wholesaling.
  
  In the HEALTH core market with a weight-loss submarket, I’d ask: “What other vehicles are people trying to use to get six-pack abs inside the weight loss submarket?” The answers to these questions would include: Keto diet, vegan diet, meatatarian diet, and bodybuilding.
  
  In the RELATIONSHIPS core market with a parenting submarket, I’d ask: “What other vehicles are people trying to use to have a better relationship with their kids inside the parenting submarket?” The answers to these questions would include: homeschooling, baby sign language, after-school sporting programs, and drama.
  
  Each of these answers is a niche within a submarket with dozens of influencers, companies, and keywords that you can target! Your submarket is where you should focus all of your Dream 100 efforts initially because this is your warmest traffic.

### Hook, Story, Offer, and The Attractive Character

- The framework that Natalie used to get over 120,000 people to buy her book Abs, Core, and Pelvic Floor is called Hook, Story, Offer.

  The hook is the image and the headline that Jessica saw as she was scrolling through her feed. It hooked her and stopped her just long enough to get her attention. It then asked Jessica to click on a link, which gave Natalie a moment to tell her story, build a relationship with Jessica, and explain the perceived value of the offer she would be making. Finally, Natalie made her an irresistible offer that would help Jessica to get out of pain and move toward pleasure. This Hook, Story, Offer framework is the pattern that you’ll see over and over again in most ads and funnels online.
  
  HOOK, STORY, OFFER
  
  It’s the core foundation for how we sell anything online. It’s how we diagnose what’s not working in every funnel that we set up. If an ad isn’t working, it’s always because of the hook, the story, or the offer. If a funnel isn’t converting, it’s always because of the hook, the story, or the offer. It really is that simple and probably the most important framework that I am teaching you to master.
  
  Hook: Now that we know exactly where our dream customers are congregating, our job is to throw hooks to them to see if we can grab their attention. The hook is the thing that grabs someone’s attention so you can tell them a story. You see thousands of hooks every day. Every email subject line is a hook, trying to grab your attention for just a moment so you’ll read that email. Every post, picture, and video you see in your feed on Facebook is a hook that is trying to get you to engage so they can tell you a story and then make you an offer. Every picture on Instagram, thumbnail on YouTube, and headline on a blog is a hook designed to grab your attention. 
  
  Anything that grabs someone’s attention is a hook, and the better you get at creating it and throwing it into your Dream 100’s congregations, the more attention you will get. What hooks can I throw out that will cause them to stop scrolling and listen long enough to hear my story? Pay attention the next time you’re scrolling to what hooks grab your attention. Why did you stop? Why did you click play? What did the hook say, and how did it make you feel? Answering these questions will help you to become amazing at developing hooks.

  Story: After the hook grabs their attention, you now have a small window to connect with them through story. There are two core goals from that story that you are about to tell them.
  - The story will increase the value of the offer that you are about to make. By telling the right story (or “epiphany bridge” stories, mentioned in Expert Secrets), you can show the perceived value of what you’re selling and the story will create a desire for them to buy now.
  - The story will build a connection with you as the Attractive Character and your brand. Even if someone doesn’t buy something today, if they connect with you, they will become your follower, and then your customer, and eventually your raving fan. Your stories will help them to build a relationship with your brand.
 
  Offer: The hook gets your customers’ attention, the story creates desire, and the last step of every message, post, email, and video is the offer. The offer doesn’t always mean asking people to buy something amazing, although this is my favorite type of offer. The offer could be as small as telling them if they “like this post” or “comment on my video” or “subscribe to my podcast” or “join my list,” you’ll give them a special thing in exchange. The better the offer is, the more likely someone is to do the thing that you actually want them to do. If people aren’t doing what you want them to do (joining your list, clicking your ads, or buying your stuff), the simplest way to fix it is often to increase the offer.
  
  The same thing is true with your ads. If you hook someone, tell them a story, and make them an offer and they still don’t buy, it’s likely that the offer isn’t good enough for them. You may need to tell a better story to increase the perceived value of the offer, or maybe you may need to make a better offer. Add more bonuses, increase how much they get, make it sexier
  
  If any of your traffic campaigns aren’t working, it’s always the hook, the story, or the offer. And if you want to solve all these problems, create better hooks, tell better stories, and make better offers.

### Work Your Way In, Buy Your Way In

- STEP #1—DIG YOUR WELL BEFORE YOU’RE THIRSTY

  Now you have your Dream 100, and they have your dream customers. The next question you should be asking yourself is the same question I asked myself: “How do I get my message in front of their audiences?” The first key to the Dream 100 is that you need to dig your well before you’re thirsty. The most common mistake that entrepreneurs make when they start their Dream 100 is to wait to start building
relationships with those people until their product is ready.  I immediately start digging my well.

  First, I subscribe to everything that my Dream 100 are publishing. If they’re on your Dream 100, they probably publish on at least one, if not many, different platforms. do your homework so that when your moment comes with your Dream 100 person, you’re prepared to talk about them. Ask them questions about their life, things they post, and topics they care about. I also watch what my Dream 100 are publishing because, in the future, I might be creating ads for these same people.
  
  Usually, when I tell people to subscribe to everything, they kind of freak out because they don’t want to join over 100 people’s email lists, subscribe to over 100 podcasts, or follow over 100 influencers on Instagram. After all, it would take several hours a day to manage that, right? But the truth is it actually won’t. For the email newsletters, I create a new email address that is set up specifically for my Dream 100 campaign, and I use that new email address to join everyone’s list. I make a filter that pushes each person’s emails instantly into a folder so my inbox stays clean.
  
  I also only use my social apps (YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) for two purposes: to produce and publish content, and to spy on my Dream 100. I don’t use them to be “social,” because this is the fastest way to ruin your life. Okay, not really, but seriously ... from this point forward, you should never look at yourself as a “consumer” of social media but as a “producer” of it.
  
  After subscribing to my Dream 100’s content, I try to buy some of their products. This allows me to see their funnels and what they’re selling on their backend and get a good idea of what they are doing. We call this process “funnel hacking,”
  
  The third and last thing I do is look for ways that I can serve my Dream 100. Remember, right now I’m not asking them to do anything for me. I’m digging my well before I’m thirsty to see what I can offer them. One of the best things I can do to help someone after buying their product or listening to their podcast or reading their blog is to talk about it socially. I may make a post on my Facebook wall or on my Instagram stories talking about an awesome podcast I heard or product I bought, telling other people that they should go buy it while tagging my Dream 100 person in the post. I’ve found that this is one of the easiest things I do to get someone’s attention and provide value to them, but it could be anything from sending them a gift to creating videos or images that they could use for their own marketing.
  
  This process may seem like a lot of work—and it is—but it’s the foundation for your entire company. Not only is it the foundation for getting traffic, it’s also the best way to figure out your place in the market’s ecosystem. What value do you have that you can provide to this market that is different? I started doing this through four very strategic phases:
  
  Phase #1 (Day 1–14): I started the process of following my Dream 100 by subscribing and listening to the content they were pushing out. During my twice-a-day, 15-minute social media binges, I would watch what each of my Dream 100 were doing, and then I would look for things that resonated with me. I would quickly comment on what they were publishing, sharing what I thought was special, and looking for ways I could serve them.
  
  Phase #2 (Day 15–30): I would then contact my Dream 100 (via email, direct message, etc.) and open up a dialogue. My goal was never to pitch them anything during this time.
  - Red Flag #1: Don’t send a templated message. So many times I see the copy/paste emails that have been sent to 500 other “influencers” that day, and these messages don’t get a response. Write each person a personal message or don’t send anything at all.
  - Red Flag #2: Don’t tell me your story yet. There will be a day and time that your Dream 100 will care about your story, but it’s not with the first message. You telling them your story is them serving you, and you have not built up the reciprocity yet. Serve first, or they will never have a chance to serve you later. Treat them right, and one good relationship can be worth millions of dollars to you.
  - Green Light #1: This isn’t the first time I’ve ever seen your face. Make sure that they’ve seen your face actively participating in meaningful ways in the discussions they create, so when they see you pop in their inbox or as a direct message, they recognize you. During this phase you are selling you to the Dream 100, not your product. If they don’t like you, they’ll never want to know more about your product.
  - Green Light #2: They tell me how great I am. I know that sounds shallow, but come on, there’s a reason we’re doing this. I remember the people who tell me how what I’m doing has impacted them.
  - Green Light #3: They’ve done their homework. They know who I am and what I care about, so when we do talk, they ask me about stuff that’s important to me.
  - Green Light #4: They don’t ask for anything now. Just don’t do it. Trust me. If you ask too early, the answer will always be no. There will be a time, but that time is not now.
  
  Phase #3 (Day 31–60): Make your Dream 100 your fan. I never ask someone to promote something for me if they haven’t experienced it. Your best promoters will always be your biggest fans. After I have plugged into each person in my Dream 100 and started the process of digging my well before I’m thirsty, there are now two ways that I can get my message in front of my Dream 100’s audiences. First, I can “work my way in” by getting traffic that I earn. Second, I can “buy my way in” by getting traffic that I control.
   
- STEP #2—WORK YOUR WAY IN (TRAFFIC THAT YOU EARN)

  Now, this concept isn’t just a launch strategy. It can and should be a consistent part of your business. To this day, I still do multiple interviews each month for people who have a platform that want to have me on as a guest. Usually at the end of the interview, the host will ask me what I’m working on or where I would like people to go for more information, and I direct them toward whatever funnel we are focusing on at the time.
  
  This can and should be a consistent part of your traffic strategy. This organic, earned traffic oftentimes converts at a much higher rate than almost any form of paid traffic. It’s harder to scale, but your hottest, best buyers will typically come from an endorsement from your Dream 100.
  
  We call this “earned” traffic because you typically aren’t paying for it with money, but you are paying for it with your time. When people are getting started and don’t have an advertising budget, I always recommend starting with earned traffic. The first eight years of my business were entirely fueled by earned traffic. I worked my way into my Dream 100, got in front of their audiences, and, with their endorsements, drove traffic into my funnels. I’ve found that paid traffic will get you started more quickly, but the second you turn off the ads, the traffic stops.
  
- STEP #3: BUY YOUR WAY IN (TRAFFIC THAT YOU CONTROL)
  
  In a perfect world, every one of your Dream 100 would say “Yes!” and promote you to their audiences on all their platforms daily Unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way. Typically, if I contact all of the 100 people on my list, I’ll usually get about 30 that will say yes, they will help, and then usually only about 10 people will actually do any real promotion. Just because you can’t get them to promote you for free doesn’t mean you can’t still get in front of their audience by running paid traffic.
  
  Now while I’m digging my well and building relationships with people, at the same time I’m buying my way in to their audiences. 
  
  First: It’s faster. Paid ads can give you immediate feedback. I can turn an ad on and within minutes have people flooding into my funnels.
  
  Second: It gives me the ability to test out different hooks and see what things people in each of my Dream 100’s audience are clicking on.
  
  Third: 90 percent of my Dream 100 will likely never actively promote me on their own, but I still want to get in front of their audiences, and this is the only way.
  
  Fourth: Paid ads are how you scale a company fast. My number-one goal with every funnel I create is to have a “breakeven” funnel, where for each $1 we put into paid ads, we get at least $1 back. 
  
  You see, there are really only two ways to scale a company fast. The first is to take on outside funding and then to use that money to either acquire other companies or pay to acquire customers. However, this way is lazy and inefficient, and I don’t recommend it. I liken this strategy to taking steroids to win a bodybuilding contest. Yes, you won, but you cheated. The better, smarter, and more efficient way to scale a business is to create a funnel that is profitable and then to put as much money into paid ads as possible. When you have a funnel that at least breaks even, then you don’t have an advertising budget and you can spend as much money as you want without it ever costing you anything to acquire customers.
  
  You might still be asking yourself, “Which is better: controlled traffic or earned traffic? The answer is, “Both are essential to the long-term success of your company.” If you only focus on paid ads, you are left at the mercy of the networks that allowed you to buy the ads. If and/or when Google or Facebook slaps or snaps, you can lose the lifeblood of your company overnight. If you only rely on earned traffic, you are completely relying on other people to get your message out to the market.
  
  While the blend of these two types of traffic is the key to building a solid foundation for your company, there is still one other type of traffic that trumps both  earned and controlled traffic. Given the chance to have only one, I’d always choose this third and last type of traffic: traffic that you own.
  
### Traffic That You Own

- When someone has spent the time to build a list of followers of 10,000, 100,000, or 1,000,000-plus people, they can send out an email to that list selling a product. To make $100K, they only need a small percentage of those people to buy the product, yet to someone working for the hourly wage it would take them all year to earn that amount.

  Recently I sent an email to my list of 32,000 subscribers and offered them a chance to buy one of my $37 e-books. Of those 32,000 people, only 232 of them decided to purchase (just 0.7%), but that put a quick $8,584 into my pocket. That would have taken the skeptics more than 171 hours (at $50 per hour) to earn the same as I did from less than 15 minutes writing the email and sending it out to my list. Mark Joyner taught me were the same: the list is the key. That’s the big secret. It is the only real asset in any company.

  THE ONLY REAL SECRET TO BUSINESS: LIST BUILDING
  
  When you look at the big online acquisitions, it’s interesting to see what the companies are actually buying. In September 2005, eBay purchased Skype for $2.6 billion.10 At the time, eBay was one of the largest online sites and their development team was arguably the best in the world. It would not have been difficult for eBay to clone Skype and make a better product. What Skype had that eBay wanted, though, was 54 million members in 225 countries and territories. eBay was purchasing the list.

  We also see it in smaller, entrepreneurial-type companies. Your list is your key to your current and future success online. This is the best type of traffic: traffic that you own. In fact, my only goal with traffic that I control and traffic that I earn is to convert it into traffic that I own. That’s what I learned from Mark Joyner. When I’m buying ads, sure, I want to sell a product, but, more importantly, I want to get those people on a list first. Because when I buy an ad, I’m getting them to click once. When they join my lists, I can email them as often as I like for free, instead of just getting them to click once. It’s the same with traffic that I earn. I want to direct these people into funnels where I get their information and get them on to my lists.
  
  That’s why the concept of the break-even funnel in Secret #4 is so vitally important. All of the traffic I control and earn is always pushed into a front-end funnel that will ask for the visitor to give me their email address, subscribe to a Messenger list, or both. That way, I can convert them from traffic that I control or earn into traffic that I own, where I can market to them for free, over and over again.
  
  UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE OF YOUR LIST
  
  It’s been said that on the low end, you should average about $1 per month for each name on your list, and when I got started, that was true. When I had 500 people on my list, I was making about $500 per month. As I grew, these numbers held true for a while:
  - 1,000 people on my list: $1,000 per month
  - 10,000 people on my list: $10,000 per month
  - 100,000 people on my list: $100,000 per month
  
  But as I’ve gotten better at building a relationship with my lists, these numbers have gone up dramatically. As a worst- case scenario, though, they should follow these metrics. For example, if you know you want to make $100,000 per year, make sure you are focused on getting at least 10,000 people on your list (10,000 people x $1 per month x 12 months = $120,000)
  
  Again, I want to note that these numbers change in every market. Most local businesses may only have 500–1,000 people on their lists, but because of their ability to build a better relationship with that list, they could be making $50– $100 per name per month, whereas with some types of lists (such as retargeting or social lists), you might only make $0.50 per name. I suggest setting a benchmark of $1 per name per month and then trying to beat it.
  
  As a side note, if you think about traditional investments like real estate, I see people all the time spend $250,000 on a rental house and hope that it brings in a positive cash flow of $500 per month. Then they’ll take up to 30 years to pay off the mortgage (i.e., “break even”) while still having to deal with broken toilets, tenants, and more. List building is a completely different investment model.
  
  You might be wondering, “Now that I’ve added someone to my list, how does that grow my company?” Well, the answer is simple. Now that you have created the most valuable thing inside your company, you can then direct your subscribers into “follow-up funnels.”
  
### Follow Up Funnels

- David Frey wrote: “A study done by the Association of Sales Executives revealed that 81 percent of all sales happens on or after the fifth contact. If you’re a small business owner and you’re only doing one or two follow-ups, imagine all the business you’re losing. Not following up with your prospects and customers is the same as filling up your bathtub without first putting the stopper in the drain!” 

  VC-backed companies will go in the hole for 6–12 months or more to generate a customer. That’s right, they sometimes don’t break even for over a year, but they can do that because they’re burning someone else’s money.
  
  THE SECRET TO QUICKLY GROW YOUR LIST WITH PAID ADS
  
  Ideally, we break even in our initial funnel, but sometimes it might take us a few days or weeks to break even using our follow-up funnels. Many times, people will lose some money inside of their front-end funnels and not break even immediately, and because of that they get scared and walk away from it. If they looked closer at their numbers, though, they’d see that they might have been just a few days away from breaking even and that they could still have kept running ads to those funnels profitably, even at a loss.
  
  When someone joins my list, I’ll build a relationship with them. I might send them a few emails making sure they’re able to download the lead magnet I gave them for free, and I might even send a video or an article helping them to get more value from the thing I just offered them. At that point, I would still be $3.00 in the hole for each lead, but I would be building a relationship with them, which means they would be more likely to open my emails and buy things from me in the future. Here’s where the fun begins. The next set of emails in my follow-up funnel would be focused on introducing them to the next funnel in my value ladder.
  
  The next step in the follow-up funnel would be to move them into one of my higher ticket funnels. We call this “funnel stacking.” In this example, the next thing I would invite them to is one of my web classes. I might send a few more emails inviting them to register for the webinar. After they went through that webinar sequence and I made an offer for one of my higher ticket products, the average dollar per lead would increase past the $3.00 I spent for the lead. At that point, I would break even and start making a profit. That means within about a week of paying for that lead, I would be in the black! Anything that those customers bought from me in the future would be pure profit.
  
  Are you seeing how this works? Sometimes the break-even happens inside of the initial front-end funnel, but other times it happens within the follow-up funnel. As soon as I know that I break even on day X of my follow-up funnel, then I go back and spend money to acquire customers, knowing that I’ll have a return on that investment at an already established point.
  
  “Amateurs focus on the first sale.”
  
  Dan Kennedy once said, “Ultimately, the business that can spend the most to acquire a customer wins.”14 With good funnels and a strong follow-up funnel, you can increase how much money you can spend to acquire a customer.
  
- MULTIDIMENSIONAL FOLLOW-UP FUNNELS

  So far I have only talked about emails inside your follow-up funnels. In a perfect world, everyone who got an email would read it and click on the links inside. Unfortunately, with people’s attention spans today (down from 20 minutes in the ’90s to just seven seconds today!), a lot of the people you send emails to will never actually open them. Some stats show that as much as 87 percent of emails go unopened! You’re battling for attention every time you send anything.
  
  As the war for attention has grown, a lot of amazing tools have been created that we can plug into our follow-up funnels to make sure people actually see our message. I’ll share with you the ones that I see as the most powerful today.
  
  Retargeting: The first, and one of my favorite tools to plug into my follow-up funnels, is retargeting ads. Have you ever been to a website, and then over the next few weeks, it seems like they’re stalking you online? Everywhere you go, you see their banner ads following you around? That is retargeting, and it’s one of the most powerful ways to push someone through your follow-up funnels and ascend them up your value ladder.
  
  Messenger: In 2011, Facebook created their Messenger program which, for many people, has replaced email as their favorite communication tool. You can add Messenger subscriber boxes into your funnels and get people joining your email list to also join your Messenger lists. This gives you the ability to follow up with people through a different channel than email. It’s a very powerful tool that has a much higher open rate than email. unlike email, where I can send email daily and not have many people upset, with Messenger, I can only send one or two messages a week without losing many subscribers. We strategically place Messenger messages within our follow-up funnels to create a conversation about once or twice per week with a goal to direct people back into a funnel or ascend them into the next one.
  
  Text Messages: We don’t normally try to get someone’s phone number on a traditional landing page, because each new field traditionally lowers conversions, but I do try to grab a phone number when people buy something from us or when they register for a webinar. We can use text broadcasts to make sure people don’t miss the webinar they’ve signed up for, let them know the statuses of their orders, and help move them into the next step in our value ladder.
  
  THE 3 CLOSES: EMOTION, LOGIC, FEAR
  
  As you have seen, we have a lot of tools that we can use to try to get someone to buy from us. But what should go inside of each message? We’ve found that the ones that give you the most leverage include messages based on:
  - Emotion
  - Logic
  - Fear (urgency and scarcity)
  
  The most powerful way to get someone to take action is by using emotion. It’s often been said that people buy things emotionally and then try to justify their purchase logically. The lead of any sales letter, the stories in my webinars, the first emails in our follow-up funnels, and the first ads in my retargeting sequences always speak to people’s emotions.
  
  The top of the page has a headline that appeals to one’s emotions, a video telling stories to get one emotionally interested in the product, and then an order form for one to take action. Fifty percent of my sales will come immediately from people who only see this top block and never scroll. They’re my emotional buyers.
  
  The next 30 percent of buyers are a little bit harder to convince. They’re the analytical buyers. They may have felt something emotionally, but they need to be able to logically convince themselves that the purchase is right for them. Often they’re afraid of what others will think if they buy it, because they have a fear that their status will decrease if the product doesn’t work for them. So under this top section of the page, I transition my message to speak toward their logic.
  
   I also let them know about the money-back guarantee if it doesn’t work so they won’t risk a decrease in status.
   
   The last 20 percent of buyers aren’t as motivated by emotion or logic, but they are motivated by a fear of missing out (FOMO). The only thing that will get them to take the leap is for them to be afraid that you’re going to take it away. Urgency comes from you giving them all the reasons why they need to buy it now, and scarcity comes from all the reasons why this will be gone soon. For this last group, I close almost every sales presentation, letter, and sequence focusing on urgency and scarcity.
   
   I just showed you how the process of Emotion → Logic → Fear works on a landing page, but it also works inside of every follow-up funnel and retargeting sequence. When someone joins a follow-up funnel, my first set of messages focuses on the emotion as I tell stories of other people who have used the product and share the hidden benefits. After a few days, I switch all my messaging to logic, and then the last set of messages will switch to fear.
   
   If I’m only sending out three emails in that step of the follow-up funnel, then I have one for each of the three closes. If I have five emails, I might spend the first three days on emotion, one day on logic, and one day on urgency and scarcity. The number of messages matters less than making sure you hit each of the closes, because each one will bring in a different group of buyers. As I make my transition to the next funnel in my follow-up funnel, I start over with emotional story selling again and get people engaged about the next funnel in the value ladder. This process is true in every type of messaging you put out.
   
- FOLLOW-UP FUNNELS (SOAP OPERA SEQUENCES) VS. BROADCASTS (DAILY SEINFELD EMAILS)

  When someone first joins your list, we plug them into a follow-up funnel. Immediately, they’re put on a Soap Opera Sequence where we tell them stories (providing an emotional close) and lead them through our follow-up funnel. The first set of emails are all about building rapport. Readers usually connect with your story (as you’re the Attractive Character in your business)
  
  Then we transition to the first funnel we’re going to promote in our sequence. We start “Season Two” of our Soap Opera Sequence (SOS) with the stories behind the new product/funnel that we’re introducing them to. We transition the SOS from us (the Attractive Character) to the first product we want to introduce. The SOS moves through emotion, logic, and fear, and it guides people into and through that first funnel. When it’s over, we move to “season three” of our SOS and start our new story about the new product/funnel that we’re introducing them to.
  
  The Daily Seinfeld Emails come after someone has moved through all the Soap Opera Sequences inside of the value ladder and they are done with our follow-up funnels.
  
  After that, people drop off the core list that has ascended your people through your value ladder, and then they’re moved to our daily broadcast list. This is the list that we use to send our daily story-based (Seinfeld) emails to lead people to our new front-end offers and get them to re- register for our webinars and promote our blog posts, podcast episodes, and affiliate offers. This is the bucket we put people into after they have dropped out of the back end of our follow- up funnel.

### Infiltrating the Dream 100

- Defeated, Arsenio explained that everyone used to answer his calls when he had his own show. But when he didn’t have his own talk show, his so-called friends avoided him. And that was the big takeaway! When you have your own show, everyone answers your calls. Earlier we talked a lot about the Dream 100, and how you can work your way in or buy your way in. In either of those situations, you have more leverage when you have your own show, or your own platform.

  Your platform is the true value that you have to provide your Dream 100. It’s more valuable than money, gifts, or anything. The Dream 100 want exposure, and your platform can provide that for them. As cool of a person as I think I am, I’m sure that if I didn’t have my platform of over 2 million entrepreneurs among my email lists, social lists, and podcast listeners, it would have been very difficult to get Tony Robbins, or any of my Dream 100, to return my calls, respond to my emails, or be interested in working with me. None of these people needed another friend. They did need, however, access to my platform, This is the key to working your way in.
  
  the more powerful thing to understand is that today you don’t have to convince a network that you should have your own show. Instead, you can click a few buttons and that fast you can have a show on all the major apps. Right now, the ABC, NBC, and CBS’s on people’s phones are:
  - Facebook (talk show)
  - Podcasts (radio)
  - YouTube (sitcom)
  - Instagram (reality TV)
  - Blogs (newspaper)
  
  More apps/channels will pop up, but as of right now, the majority of eyeballs are focused on these apps, which each gives you the ability to create your own show for free. But is having your own show the same as having your own list? I would say that the answer is, “Kind of.” With your own list, you own the traffic, but with your own show, you’re renting space and trying to earn eyeballs on someone else’s network.
  
  If Facebook decides they don’t like your show for some reason (and they’ve been known to do it), they can cancel your show or your account without a warning.  Until you own the traffic, you’re always left to the whims of the network. So even when starting your own show, remember that the goal is still to turn that traffic that you’re earning into traffic that you own.
  
  YOUR PRIMARY DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL: EMAIL
  
  The key to success with your show is how many people you can get to actually consume what you’re creating. You might be able to rely on each platform promoting you for free, but I never like to include that as part of my marketing plans. Sometimes we’ll create an episode that goes viral and we’ll get millions of views for free, but that’s not something we bank on. Instead, we need to ask ourselves, “After my new episode is live, how can I get people to go and consume it ASAP?” The best way to do that is to leverage the list that you’ve already been building.
  
  We spend all our efforts to convert all traffic we control and traffic that we earn into traffic that we own (our own list) because when we have our own list, we control our own destiny. For that reason, I always look at free, viral traffic as the gravy on top of what might come if I promote the video to the best of my abilities, and I make my number-one goal first and foremost to promote each episode I publish.
  
  In addition to email, you’ll want to continue to build up other lists and distribution channels, such as direct messenger lists on Facebook and followers on Instagram, so you can do “swipe-ups.” Each platform has its own version of a list, but email is the only one you own; you’re renting all the rest and you could lose them at any time.

- YOUR PRIMARY SHOW CHANNEL: TEXT, VIDEO, OR AUDIO

  To begin with, you shouldn’t try to create a show on every channel. Doing that will hurt your ability to grow at all. For now, the key is to focus on one channel. for now, you need to focus on just two channels: your primary distribution channel (email) and your primary show channel.
  
  The channel you should be growing your primary show on depends on you, your personality, and your talents. If you’re still not sure which platform you’d like to create your show on, I’d recommend looking at which platform you consume the most content on. Typically, if you love YouTube and spend a lot of time watching videos, you’re going to have the best success creating videos for that platform, because you understand it. If you listen to podcasts a lot, that’s probably the best place to start. Similarly, if you read a lot of blogs, that’s probably the best place to start.
  
  Remember that for now, you should only be building one show on one channel. Do not try to build more than one at this point. In Secret #15, I will show you how to leverage this one primary channel into all the secondary channels, but that does not come now. Focus all your efforts on making your first show successful.
  
  STARTING YOUR SHOW (FINDING YOUR VOICE)
  
  I knew that if I was going to do my own show, I had to be consistent or it wouldn’t work. Out of all the types of shows that I could publish (audio, video, or text), I knew that it had to be simple or I’d never stick to it. The good news for me (and also for you) is during your first episodes, the ones where you are the worst, no one is listening to you yet! That’s why it’s so essential to start publishing your show now, even when you’re not good at it. In the process of doing your show, you will find your voice. Don’t look at your stats, downloads, or numbers at first, because you’re just trying to build the foundation for something great, and it will take time. Let me walk you through the steps that will make your own show a success.
  
  Step #1) Publish daily for at least a year: The first commitment that you have to make is that you will be consistent. If you can publish every day for a year, you’ll never have to worry about money problems again. During the process, you will find your voice, and your audience will have time to find you.
  
  How many great TV shows have you discovered in season three or later? I started watching Game of Thrones after they had released five seasons. This is such a common experience. There is so much content being produced that we can’t possibly discover it all. If step one in building an audience is to create great content, step two is to endure long enough to get noticed. You must be publishing or you will never become relevant, and you must continue publishing if you want to remain relevant.
  
  Step #2) Document the journey: The biggest question and the largest fear that most people have when I tell them to start their own show is they have no idea what they will talk about. “Document, Don’t Create.” hunger to make the perfect piece of content is what’s actually crippling them.
  
  It’s true that if you want to be seen or heard on social media, you have to put out valuable content on a regular basis. You should be doing a YouTube vlog or podcast or some sort of long-form audio/video series at least once a week. You should be posting on Instagram and/or Snapchat stories at least six to seven times a day. I’ll give you the biggest tip when it comes to content creation: Document. Don’t create.
  
  And don’t get confused—just because you’re “documenting” doesn’t mean you’re not creating content. It’s just a version of creating that is predicated more on practicality instead of having to think of stories or fantasy—something that’s very hard for most people (including myself). Think about it: you can ponder about the strategy behind every post and fabricate yourself into this “influential person” ... or you can just be yourself.
  
  You think that some 30- or 40- or 50-year-old is going to listen to your rant video with cynicism and think, What does this kid know? But, one of the biggest mistakes people make when creating content for their personal brand is trying to oversell themselves because they think that’s what’s going to get people’s attention. Whether you’re a business coach or motivational speaker or artist, I think it’s much more fruitful to talk about your process than about the actual advice you “think” you should be giving them.
  
  Documenting your journey versus creating an image of yourself is the difference between saying “You should ...” versus “My intuition says ...” Get it? It changes everything. I believe that the people who are willing to discuss their journeys instead of trying to front themselves as the “next big thing” are going to win.
  
  People listen to my podcasts, read my books, and watch my videos because they’re trying to figure out more ways to market their business. I’m not publishing because I know everything about this topic, I’m publishing because I’m obsessed with this topic. “We get paid a lot to think for other people.”
  
  So my first question for you as you start your show is this: “What is the big result that you’re obsessed with? What are you trying to learn for yourself anyway that you can document as you’re discovering it in real time?”
  
  So, the big question is this: “How are entrepreneurs like us, who didn’t cheat and take on Venture Capital, who are spending money from our own pockets, how do we market in a way that lets us get our products and services and the things that we believe in, out to the world, yet still remain profitable?” That is the question, and this podcast will give you the answers.
  
  Inside of this frame, I can talk about, share, and interview people on anything related to helping people sell more of the things that they believe in. In any case, how cool is it now, six years later, that I have documented the entire journey from business failure to growing ClickFunnels to being an over $100-million-per-year company?
  
  Step #3) Testing your material: Publishing your show daily, as you’re documenting your journey, will give you a chance to start testing your material. You’ll discover what messages connect with people, which episodes get shared, and which ones don’t. You’ll see which messages get people to show up and comment and which messages don’t connect. It’s this very process of you showing up consistently and publishing that will help you to refine your message, find your voice, and attract your dream customers to you. It doesn’t matter if your end goal is a book, a webinar, a keynote presentation, a viral video, or something else, the more you publish and test your material, the clearer your message will become and the more people you will attract.
  
  Step #4) Introduction to Your Dream 100: When you start your show, typically you’ll use the first few episodes to tell your origin story, why you created the show, and what people should expect. These initial episodes are important because there will be people who find your show a week from now, some a year from now, and others won’t find it for years, but when they do, and when they get hooked, most people will go back to episode one and binge-listen (or read or watch) to catch up on what they missed. Even though these early episodes are old, they’ll still likely be a starting point for many people that fall in love with your content. After the initial episodes, it’s time to start using your show to infiltrate your Dream 100.
  
  Who are the people on your Dream 100 that have an interesting story they could tell that will relate to your show and have a following of people that you can promote their episode to? You have a platform that you can now leverage to get people on your show, and they have a network that you can advertise their episode to. It’s a huge win-win. In a perfect world, they would promote their episode to their entire following when it goes live (and that does happen at times), but even if they don’t promote, you can still buy ads targeting their audiences on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, or wherever their following is.
  
  The reality is that many people you ask will say no, and that’s okay, because you don’t need everyone. You just need one: one guest that you can then leverage to get the others. Typically, most markets have a “good ol’ boys” club atmosphere, and usually a lot of your Dream 100 will be in one or more clubs. To infiltrate and get access to that club, you don’t need to get access to all of them; you just need to have one of the cool kids think you’re cool, and then you’re in.
  
  So your job now is to look at your Dream 100 and start asking them to be on your show. Many will say no, but don’t let that stop you. You only need one yes. As you have a chance to interview your Dream 100 on your podcast, you’ll be giving them a platform for which they’ll be grateful. You’ll be able to spend time building a relationship as you interview them on your show (digging your well before you’re thirsty), and you can tap into their audience to promote their episode, build your show, and get access to their followers.

## Fill Your Funnel

- we’ll be shifting more into the tactics of how to fill your funnels with your dream customers on the following four advertising platforms:
  - Instagram
  - Facebook
  - Youtube
  - Google
  
  I could have gone deep into dozens of other platforms, including LinkedIn, Snapchat, Pinterest, TikTok, and Twitch, but I’m only exploring these four platforms in order to show you a framework and pattern that you can learn and use on any platform that you’d like to get traffic from in the future. Depending on when you’re reading this book, admittedly, some of these platforms may no longer be relevant, and there will likely be many to come that no one has even heard of yet.
  
  Showing you the strategy and tactics on one platform is the equivalent of “giving a man a fish,” and teaching you the framework to get traffic from every platform is the equivalent of “teaching a man how to fish.”
  
  THE “FILL YOUR FUNNEL” FRAMEWORK
  
  - Step #1—Understand the history and the goal of the new platform: If you want to know where the platform is going, you have to know where it came from. How did Google start? Where did Facebook come from? How did the algorithms change and, more importantly, why did they change? What was the purpose behind them? If you can understand why they made the changes, then you can start thinking like them. This is so important because by the time you are reading some of these chapters, the algorithms may have already shifted, so it’s essential that you understand the history so you can see where we are today. As you start getting a layout of each platform’s history, you’ll quickly start to see what their end goals are.
  
    Google wants to make sure that they give their users the best search results possible. Facebook wants to make sure you love the things that show up in your feed. Once you understand that creating the best user experience possible is their goal, then you can start asking yourself how you can align with their goals. The goal of spammers is always to hack the algorithm to get what they want, which always provides short-term gains, because as soon as the spammers are identified, the loopholes that they have been exploiting are taken away. Instead, if you align with the wills of the network and give them what they want, then they’ll give you what you want: tons of traffic.
  
  - Step #2—Find and model your Dream 100: The next question is, who on this platform has already figured this out? Who has already identified your dream customers, who is publishing to them, and who is getting rewarded by the platform by getting tons of views or likes
    - Question #1: Who is your dream customer?
    - Question #2: Where are they congregating?
    - Question #3: Who are your Dream 100 on this platform who have already congregated your dream customers?
    
    so if you want to know what the platform wants today, in real time, then you have to be watching closely what they’re doing in real time. Here are the three things it will take to funnel hack social algorithms:
    
    Follow each of your Dream 100 and spend 10 minutes each day watching what they are doing. Write down the answers to these questions: What are they posting?, How are they getting people to engage with what they post?, What paid ads are they running?

    During these 10 minutes, try to comment, like, and engage with as many things they are doing each day as possible.
  
    Notice the pattern of what is working right now and model it for your posts (funnel hacking). This will give you a pulse on what is working in the market on that platform right now. It gives you the ability to see in real time what the algorithms are rewarding today.
    
    Funnel hacking is not copying. Funnel hacking is modeling, and there is a big difference between copying and modeling. You’re looking for the types of things the platforms’ algorithms are currently rewarding that you can then model.
    
    When the pattern interrupt becomes the pattern, it stops being as effective. Notice that I didn’t say they stop working; they just become less effective. So if you are starting right now, and you see all of your Dream 100 doing something, you should still model what they’re doing. It may not be as effective as a new pattern interrupt, but it is the current pattern that is working, so that’s where you start. After you model the pattern that’s working, the next phase of funnel hacking the social algorithms is to look for and test ideas that will become the next pattern interrupt
    
    Following your Dream 100 lets you have your fingers on the pulse of what’s working currently in each platform. You can model ideas that they’re trying, come up with your own unique ideas, and test them both to see which ones stick. Because the algorithms are always changing, it’s essential that you network with and stay close to your Dream 100.
  - Step #3—Identify the publishing strategy and create your publishing plan:
  
    Each platform has multiple ways that you can publish your content, so it’s essential to understand the strategy for each section and how you can weave it into your daily publishing schedule. For example, Instagram lets you do stories that are similar to a reality show, but you also have your profile, which is more like a picture gallery. Questions I would start asking myself are: “How often should you be doing Stories and what do you post on your profile, and how often?” There are a lot of possibilities, so you want to understand all the publishing opportunities on each platform, decide which you want to focus on, and figure out a plan to make it simple to consistently publish on your chosen platform.
    
  - Step #4—Work your way in:
  
    After I start publishing on each platform and I have content that my dream customers can see, I look for ways to work my way into the Dream 100. I start asking myself the question, how can I get organic, free exposure to the audiences of the people who have already congregated my dream customers, and then get these people to join my lists and become traffic that I own?

  - Step #5—Buy your way in:
  
    While I’m working my way in, I want to stimulate growth as fast as possible. The best way is to buy ads targeting the followers of my Dream 100 and then get these people to join my lists and become traffic that I own.
    
  - Step #6—Fill your funnel:
  
    As you’re publishing, working your way in, and buying your way in, the goal is always to convert all the traffic and attention into traffic that you own. You do that by pushing people into your funnels where you can get their contact information, sell them your front-end products, and then push them through a follow-up funnel to ascend them up your value ladder.

### Fill Your Funnel Organically (Working Your Way In)

- “Well, when you go to a party, do you just talk about what you do? ‘Hey, I’m Perry, and I sell stuff. Would you like to buy some stuff from me?’ No, of course not. If you did, you’d be the biggest jerk at the party. Everyone would avoid you. “Okay, then what do we talk about on the social networking sites? As an introvert, I’ve never really networked in real life, so I’m not sure how or what I should be saying.”

  “You talk about what’s going on in your life,” Social networking is just a great big party.
  
  “The second part of the process is how I use my personal profile on each social platform,” Perry continued. “My personal profile is my house, it’s my home, it’s where I live. It has most of my thoughts, my information, and stuff that is interesting to me. They can see the things that I like to talk about.”
  
  “Now, this is how it works. When I go into groups and start networking, or I see someone else’s posts in my feed, I go and participate in the conversations and make friends. As they see me consistently show up, they will want to drop by my house and see what I’m all about. Give them some free stuff like chips and dip (free content) to get them to come to your house. Then when they’re at my house, that’s where I invite them to take action with me: register for my webinar, attend my next event, read my new book, or join my newsletter list. That’s how I invite people from my house into my funnels. Those selling conversations don’t have a place on social media, but they do at your house. You can direct people into your funnels from the posts you make on your own personal profile. If you provide value on the social platforms, people will come running to your house because they want more of you, and from there, they will flow into your funnels.”
  
   I changed my tactics, deleted all my posts that were trying to sell my products, and started serving, interacting, being entertaining, and having fun with my followers.
   
   I wanted to give you this context before we discussed any of the specific networks, because this is how we “work our way in.” It’s the core concept that you have to master if you want to have success with social media, no matter which platform you are focusing on. Those who just spam their message to their followers will always think that social media doesn’t work. Even if they do get some short-term results, they won’t last. On the other hand, those who play the longer game and plant seeds with their followers will end up with a constant stream of traffic flooding into their funnels.
   
   PRODUCER, NOT CONSUMER
   
   I’ll start by saying that yes, you are currently spending way too much time on social media. I don’t care who you are; you are probably already spending way too much time consuming social media. If you’re spending more than 10 minutes a day consuming social media, then you are wasting your time. The keyword here is “consuming.” As of today, you are no longer a consumer of social media. You are a producer of social media. There is a big difference.
   
   The first step in this process is to do a social media reset. That means unfriending and unfollowing almost everyone on every platform that you’ll be using to generate traffic. That way, you won’t be distracted by the nonsense that everyone around you is posting. From here on out, you’ll use social media as a business tool, not a social tool. After you unfriend everyone, I suggest only following your Dream 100 on each platform. That way, when you log in to any of the platforms, you’ll be able to quickly get a glimpse of what they’re posting and get ideas for things that are working well that you can model. Also, you will be able to start digging your well with these people by commenting on their posts and messaging them through direct messages.
   
   Now that your social feed has been cleaned up, go and look for the social parties that have the most people engaged in them. You wouldn’t go to a party that only has a few dozen people; instead you would look for the largest parties in town where you can get the most exposure for your efforts. Depending on the platform, you’ll be looking for the largest groups, podcasts, blogs, videos, and Fan Pages that you can go to and become the life of the party. As you participate in these groups and serve their audiences, the people will naturally start coming back to your home.
   
    I want to bring up the concept of producer versus consumer now so you will be able to look at everything that happens in the next few chapters through this lens. This way, you can focus on serving your audience, not wasting your precious time.

### Fill Your Funnel with Paid Ads (Buying Your Way In)

- Adding paid ads into the strategies you’ve been learning about is like adding lighter fluid to a pile of charcoal. You will get results faster on any funnel you want to promote and be able to more predictably control sales over the long-term. As always, we’ll be staying away from the exact tactics that often change and focus instead on the overarching strategies that will help you to build out your paid traffic plan.

  One thing John told me as we were mapping out this chapter was: “While it’s true that each advertising network has little intricacies and nuances that can take a while to get used to, and there are definitely tips and tricks that can incrementally improve your performance, the good news is that the strategy of advertising on these networks is the same. The specifics of the platforms can be learned with online tutorials, or they can be hired out, but the strategy needs to be understood by you (the entrepreneur) in order to succeed.”
  
- WHAT IS MY ADVERTISING BUDGET?

  If they have a funnel that is break even or profitable, then they don’t have an advertising budget. Their goal is to spend as much money profitably as possible because each dollar they spend turns into more dollars. We’ll keep running ads for as long as it stays profitable.
  
  I never like putting very much of my money at risk at any given time, so with each new funnel, as soon as it’s live, we set up a few ads, give it a small test budget, and see what happens. The funnels that flop are sent back to the drawing board to get reworked, and the funnels that work are scaled to see how much money we can profitably spend.
  
  PROSPECTING ADS VS. RETARGETING ADS

  John explained, “Prospecting ads are the act of reaching out into the networks to find cold traffic or people who aren’t familiar with you or your offers and hook them long enough to get their attention. After we’ve gotten their attention and gotten them to engage with us (engage could mean they watched, liked, or commented on an ad), then we move them from the ‘prospecting’ pool into the ‘retargeting’ buckets. We then advertise to these people differently and work to warm them up and then get them into our value ladder.”
  
  STEP #1: CREATE LOTS OF PROSPECTING ADS TO “HOOK” YOUR DREAM CUSTOMERS
  
  When you’re thinking about prospecting ads, you’re looking at a huge ocean of people—all who need your product or service but all who have a different reason why. If you try to create just one hook, it may last for a while and grab the people who are looking for that hook, but it will dry up very fast. The more creative you can put into the prospecting ocean, the more fish (dream customers) you’re going to be able to pull out.
  
  Targeting for Prospecting Ads
  
  The next step after you have made your creative is to figure out who to show it to. John explains:
  
  Dream 100: The best place to start is your Dream 100 list for that platform. When you’re running ads on Facebook and Instagram, you can target people who have an interest in a certain thought leader, brand, or celebrity. You’ll find many (but probably not all) of your Dream 100’s followers targetable this way in the Ads Manager. For YouTube, you can specify that you’d like your ads to show in front of your Dream 100’s videos both individually or their channel as a whole.
  
  Ideal customer avatar: Second on your targeting list is your ideal customer avatar. Think about their interests, their age, their career, their home life, and anything else you can identify. Most of these ad platforms will allow you to get pretty specific on who you show your ads to.
  
  Overlapping sections of multiple audiences: Some ad networks let you get more specific in targeting your audiences by layering on multiple criteria and then just targeting the overlapping sections. Think of three overlapping circles, each representing one of the audiences above and then imagine a center area where they all overlap. This center area represents the sweet spot where your dream customer is most likely to be. An example of this would be to not just target Tony Robbins’s followers in one campaign, business owners in another, and women between the ages of 35–55 in a third campaign. Being smart with your audiences and layering them can really help bring your costs down and improve your results.
  
  Algorithms: The last thing, and honestly where the networks are working toward, is for you to rely on the algorithms to do a lot of the legwork for you. The platform algorithms can work with that data and actually start lending a hand in your targeting efforts. In Google and YouTube, they’re called Similar Audiences, and in Facebook and Instagram, they’re called Lookalike Audiences. In both cases, you decide which bucket to use as the source, the algorithm then looks deep into who those people are, and then matches up others in your specified geographical range who are most similar to them (and thus more likely to care about what you have to offer).
  
  80/20 Rule for Prospecting
  
  One thing to note when running prospecting ads is that these types of ads are the most expensive, but they are vital for two reasons. First, it’s through prospecting that you find out who is actually responding to your ads so your targeting becomes more on point (which brings your costs down). Second, it’s prospecting that fills your retargeting buckets. If you stop prospecting, you’ll soon find yourself with no one to retarget to. When you put up your first ads, they’re almost always going to a colder audience, a group of people who don’t know you and don’t know what you have to offer. It will always be more expensive and less efficient to advertise to this crowd, but when you’re getting started, you have no other choice. Results will come slower with these prospecting efforts and costs to get a lead or a sale will be much higher (sometimes even so high that you’re losing money to begin with). In fact, don’t be surprised if you spend 80 percent of your advertising budget in this category and it only generates 20 percent of your results.
  
  But if you hold strong, there is a light at the end of this tunnel. You see, while one purpose of the prospecting campaigns is to generate some leads and sales upfront, the bigger purpose is to fill all your retargeting audiences (which include your social followings and lists). It’s from these new followers and retargeting audiences that you’ll often see 80 percent of your results while only using 20 percent of your budget.
  
- STEP #2: USE A RETARGETING FUNNEL TO CREATE CUSTOMERS

  In Secret #6, we talked about the power of following up with your prospects through follow-up funnels using their email address. But what about all of the people who watch your videos or come to your funnel but don’t give you their email addresses? How do you follow up with all of them? The answer is through retargeting ads. There are three specific audiences that are essential to a high- performance retargeting plan. Each is based on how far viewers got along the customer journey.
  
  Audience #1—Engaged: The first audience you’ll want to build is an audience based on viewers having engaged with you. Did they watch your YouTube videos this week? Did they watch one of your prospecting ads and make a comment recently? These people interacted with your post but never left the platform to pursue your offer. While they have made a minor commitment to you, it’s nothing serious. These people are worth some continued ad dollars but not too much or for too long. I tend to run an ad to this audience for up to five days. If they haven’t visited my landing page by that point, I let them fall out of the audience and return to the prospecting pools from whence they came.
  
  Audience #2—Landed: The second audience you’ll want to build is made up of the people who clicked through and landed on your page. These people took a bigger commitment, left the platform, and visited your sales funnel. While they trusted you with their curiosity and visited your page, they didn’t take any further action by opting in or purchasing. I tend to run an ad to this audience for up to seven days trying to get them to come back and take me up on my lead magnet. Again, if they don’t opt in or buy within seven days, I just let them fall out of this audience.
  
  Audience #3—Owned: The third type of audience you’ll want to have is made up of those who did take your lead magnet and those who purchased. These people have made a large commitment and have entrusted you with email addresses and credit card numbers in exchange for your goods. This is the traffic that you now own. Not only are they now on your follow-up funnel sequences, but they’re also prime candidates for seeing ads for your next offer or an offer one step up the value ladder.
  
  Unlike prospecting ads where I’m making new creative as often as possible, with your retargeting campaigns, you’re focusing on creating them once and you will never touch them again. It’s similar to a Soap Opera Sequence inside of a follow-up funnel that you write once, and it lasts forever. As we move people through the retargeting buckets, we use the same three closes you learned about earlier: starting with emotion, then moving to logic, and ending with fear (urgency/scarcity). That is how we pull people into action throughout each retargeting campaign.
  
  The lowest hanging fruit in the advertising world is running ads to your subscribers, followers, and ever-growing lists that you own. And while only a third of the emails you send may get opened, you can always run ads to your lists, often reaching those who didn’t originally open the emails and greatly increasing your overall conversions from these lists.

### Instagram Traffic Secrets

- STEP #1: UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY AND THE GOAL

  If you are “working your way in,” then you win this game by:
  - Attracting followers
  - Creating content that engages them and keeps them coming back to the platform for more
  
  As you do that, you can use that attention to get free, organic traffic into your funnels. If you are “buying your way in,” you win by showing your ads to your Dream 100’s followers and pushing them into your funnels. As with all platforms, I believe we should be playing both sides: working our way in and buying our way in.
  
  STEP #2: FIND YOUR DREAM 100 ON THIS PLATFORM
  
  The first step, as you’ll soon see with every platform, is to identify the Dream 100 that have already congregated your dream customers on the platform you are starting on. Follow each of them and set up a plan to spend a few minutes each day viewing all their Stories, posts, and ads. This will help you to identify the patterns that are making these people successful. Each day, I spend three to five minutes viewing my Dream 100’s posts looking for:
  - What pictures “hook” me and make me want to read the caption
  - Which captions make me want to take an action
  
  At the same time, I:
  - Like the posts from my Dream 100 
  - Comment on at least 10 of my Dream 100’s posts each day (digging my well)
  
  I also spend five minutes watching Instagram Stories from my Dream 100:
  - Looking for cool ideas on ways they’re engaging people
  - Checking out where their swipe-ups push me to
  - Messaging (DM’ing) on at least 10 of their videos (digging my well)
  - Looking for the swipe-up ads that are shown to me and funnel hacking them (swiping up on them)
  
  Remember, you’re now a producer of social media, not a consumer. Don’t get caught in the trap of following tons of interesting people who will distract you and waste your time.
  
- STEP #3: IDENTIFY THE PUBLISHING STRATEGY AND CREATE YOUR PUBLISHING PLAN

  Here are the core areas of the platform we’ll be focusing on. The first I call “content hooks,” where you are producing images and videos in a way to grab your dream customers and turn them into your followers. We rarely, if ever, actually sell anything in this content; we only focus on getting people to like, comment, and follow.
  - Instagram profile (your gallery)
  - Instagram TV (your produced video content)
  
  The second section of the app is your home. This is where you’re able to direct people into your funnels and actually sell.
  - Instagram Stories (your reality show)
  - Instagram Live (your live show)
  
  Again, I want to mention that these platforms, their features, and the strategies for them are always evolving, so view this chapter as a baseline, and watch your Dream 100 closely so you can model and innovate on any and all algorithm changes as they come.
  
  Again, copying is not the goal; on the contrary, copying is illegal and unethical. Modeling is watching what others in your market are doing so you can get ideas on what you can create. To have success on Instagram or on any platform, you have to be you. Your brand and your personality are the keys to getting people to follow and engage with you. The differences you bring into the ecosystem that you serve is the secret that will create your true fans.
  
  The first step, then, when setting up Instagram is to quickly communicate in your bio who you are as the Attractive Character. When people find you on Instagram, the first thing they’ll do is check out your bio. You also get one link that you can use to direct people back into one of your funnels (converting them from traffic that you’ve earned into traffic that you own). I suggest looking at your Dream 100’s bios, seeing what’s working, choosing what you like, and modeling them to create your own unique bio.
  
  Instagram Profile Strategy (Your Gallery)

  Your Instagram profile is the core foundation of your Instagram strategy. The hook (your pictures): After someone looks at your bio, the next thing they’ll see is a grid of all the pictures and videos that you’ve posted. Each picture is a hook that can potentially grab someone who is scrolling on Instagram and pull them into your funnels. 
  
  Jenna Kutcher give a presentation on her “JK5 Method” framework. I started using it a few years ago, and I still use it to this day because it makes posting to my profile simple and fun. To implement the JK5 Method, you first need to create five main categories of things you’re passionate about. This will help to give you a recognizable brand, and as you post images, you’ll simply rotate through these categories so your followers get a good understanding of who you are beyond what you sell.
  
  For Jenna, her five categories are marriage, body positivity, photography, fashion, and travel. If you scroll through her profile, you’ll notice that she cycles through these categories. The categories I came up with for my brand were family, funnels, faith, entrepreneurship, and personal development.

  No two categories live next to each other in the grid, giving you extra visual element, but also giving people a way to find a way to connect with you, even if they currently aren’t on the market for what you’re selling.
  
  It’s important we talk about the overall vibe of your “grid.” Essentially, your grid is what users see when they scroll through to see multiple images all lined up in rows of three. It’s easy to get obsessive about your overall grid aesthetic but what I love about the JK5 is that it gives people an overarching view of your brand when they click to see your full profile. If you truly follow the five- category rotation, viewers will see more than just what you sell but be able to also see if they can connect to your account enough to FOLLOW you. 
  
  When you’re posting on your profile, never post in real time; your posts should be thought out and strategic. (Real time posting is for Instagram Stories.) I suggest creating a new album for each of the five categories in your JK5. Then look back through your camera roll and move all the existing pictures you’ve taken in the past into these albums. Moving forward, when you take new pictures with your phone, always add them into these albums.
  
  Instagram also allows you to post videos on your profile that are under 60 seconds, so as you capture short videos that fit into your JK5, save them in your albums as well. Before posting any picture or video, though, I highly recommend using Jenna’s “ABCDQ Test” to see if it is “on brand” and therefore worthy for your profile. Here is the test:
  - Aesthetic: Does it visually show something that fits the personality of my brand?
  - Brand: Is it aligned with my dream client or something they will engage with?
  - Consistent: Is it consistent in terms of color or quality to fit within my overall feed?
  - Diversity: Is this something different than my last post? Does it create recognition beyond what I sell?
  - Quality: Is this up to the quality I want my clients/followers to expect? If this stood alone, would it fit my brand?
  
  The story (captions): After you run it through the ABCDQ Test and you’re ready to post the image, you need to think about arguably the most important question of all: “What am I going to say about this picture?” The picture is the hook that brings people in and grabs their attention, but the caption tells your story and tries to engage the reader before you make your offer or CTA.
  
  Goal of Post. Each post you make should have one goal. As I post any picture and write its caption, the first thing I do is decide if the hook is meant to inspire, educate, or entertain:
  - Inspire: It compels others to feel inspired and capable of big things.
  - Educate: It teaches or educates your followers on a subject.
  - Entertain: It provides entertainment for your followers.
  
  Type of Caption. After I decide the goal of the post, I try to figure out the type of caption to post. According to Jenna, the three most common types of captions and how to use them in business are:
  - Tell a story: The posts that do the best on Instagram have one thing in common: they invite you into the story and make you feel a part of the moment, as if you’re experiencing it beyond the screen. I’m not talking “once upon a time”–type stories but relatable life experiences that others can connect with.
  - Ask a question: Having an audience (whether it’s 10 people or 1,000 people) gives you access to people that can help you create the perfect offer! When you’re not sure what to post, ask a question. People love to feel heard and be able to share their opinions. At least once a week I love to ask a question. Often, it’s as simple as: “What is the best book you’ve read recently?” or as complex as: “Tell me what you’re struggling with when it comes to Instagram so I can help you!”
  - Make a list: You can have a lot of fun with captions by sharing a short list! Some examples include: three things people might not know about you, five facts about your business, three ways to use your products, or the seven best books you’ve ever read. Lists are a fun way to deliver a caption that is easy to read or interesting; they can also further connect you to your followers in unexpected ways beyond the traditional brand stories you tell!
 
 Hashtags. So what is a hashtag, and why do you need it? If you think of Instagram as a huge filing cabinet, then the hashtags are the filing folders. When someone searches a hashtag, Instagram finds all the images that use that same hashtag and gives you a gallery of only those images.
 
 You can use up to 30 hashtags with each post to help your images, or hooks, show up in the searches and feeds of your dream customers. Hashtags are the equivalent of keywords in search engines. Sometimes, you can put your hashtags in your actual caption (we call these overt hashtags) where your audience will see them, but typically most of your hashtags will be posted in the first comment after you post your image (we call these covert keywords).
 
 There are many online research tools that can help you to figure out the best hashtags for your posts, and I do recommend using them, but the easiest way to research what hashtags you may want to use is to go back to your Dream 100.
 
 The offer (your call to action): The last step in creating your post is your CTA. Every single post needs a CTA, and it can vary from being a very small ask to being a big CTA. Examples of small asks include: “Double tap,” “Hit the ‘like’ button,” “Post an emoji,” or “Comment below.” Examples of bigger calls to action include: “Share this post,” “Tag 3 friends,” “Click the link in my bio,” or “Sign up for ____.”
 
 When people comment, you should be responding to their comments. This will get them more likely to comment in the future, and it gives other people extra motivation to comment as well. Now, let’s quickly recap the basic process to follow when making posts on your Instagram profile:
 - Follow the JK5 Method and create five main categories of things you’re passionate about.
 - Each day, post two pictures on your profile (rotate through your JK5 categories).
 - Decide the goal of each post: Inspire, Educate, or Entertain.
 - Decide the type of caption to use: Story, Ask a Question, or Make a List.
 - Choose the hashtags that will make your post show up for your dream customer.
 - Add a CTA to get your audience to engage with you.

- Instagram TV Strategy (Your Produced Video Content) -- Instagram TV was originally created to be a competitor of YouTube.
  
  Instagram Stories Strategy (Your Reality Show) -- At the top of the Instagram app, above your feed, you’ll find a section showing the “Stories” for each of the people that you follow (your Dream 100). Each video is just 15 seconds long, and you can post as many each day as you’d like. Because they disappear after 24 hours, you don’t have to be as methodical about each post, caption, and CTA as you are with your profile posts. These Stories are more freestyle. Personally, I look at my Instagram Stories as my personal reality show where my fans and followers can see behind the scenes of what I’m doing each day. I’m literally documenting my journey through the day in short, 15-second mini videos.
  
  By letting them participate in the process, they’re more invested in what I’ve actually been doing. They’re more likely to buy what I am creating when it’s ready. Instagram Stories are the most powerful way I’ve ever seen to have your audience build a relationship with you as the Attractive Character. Each day, I usually try to make at least one pitch for something I’m excited for. Instagram stories are my home where I’m able to push people into my funnels and actually sell to them.
  
  After your account grows to 10,000 followers, though, you can unlock a really cool feature called “swipe up.” If you’ve been following others on Instagram, you’ve undoubtedly seen people do this before. They’ll make a pitch for something and tell you to swipe up to get access to it. When they swipe up on the screen, they will be redirected to any link you want.

  Every day, I try to make 10–30 posts on Instagram Stories throughout the day documenting my journey. I’ll typically make one that directs people to my profile to comment on whatever picture I posted that day. I’ll also make one with a swipe-up CTA such as getting them to visit a funnel, listen to a new podcast episode, watch a video on YouTube, or engage with me in a way outside of the Instagram platform.
 
  Story Highlights: These show up under your bio and above your grid. The way you use Highlights ties back to the JK5 Method, where you pick the five categories that your brand will be known for and create a “Highlight” for each one.
  
  “Highlights” mini webinar hack: We have a little trick that we use to leverage Highlights to sell a lot of products. About once per month, I pick one of my products that I want to promote. I block out a full day in my Stories devoted to promoting that product with a mini webinar. Basically, throughout the day, I’ll post 15–50 Stories going through a scripted presentation to sell one of my products. Of course, I’ll usually make a ton of sales on that day. But because I save it as a Highlight, it will continue to sell for me every day.
  
  In the first three Stories, I ask three yes or no questions that I know will hook my viewers. For those who have read Expert Secrets, these questions will seem familiar as they sync with the perfect webinar script. Question one is about the vehicle that I’m trying to put them into, question two relates to their internal struggle, and question three deals with their external fears. 
  
  My next few Stories will relate back to the questions I just asked. I like to use the framework: Feel, Felt, Found. I might say something like: I understand how you feel ..., I felt the same way ..., This is what I found ... Then I make a few Stories introducing a special offer I created that will solve the problems people said yes to in the first three Stories.
  
  Over the next 5–20 Stories, I’ll show the proof. I’ll say something like, “Don’t take my word for it. Check out what others are saying.” Then I’ll post as many proof images, slides, and videos that I have related to the offer. This is one of my favorite ways to get consistent sales from Instagram. As people land on your profile and start following you, one of the first things they look at are your Highlights, so having a few in there that push your front-end funnels
  
  Instagram Live Strategy
  
  The last way to publish on Instagram is Instagram Live. Because Instagram Live and Facebook Live are so similar in their functionality and use, I won’t be spending much time on Instagram Live. One difference between Facebook Live and Instagram Live is that all Lives on Instagram are stored on the platform for only 24 hours, and then they’re gone. On Facebook, however, your Lives are stored on the platform forever, so you can continue to boost and promote your Lives. I suggest you focus all your Live efforts on Facebook as your message can get more views over the long run.
  
  Your Publishing Plan
  
  When I first started looking at this platform, I thought that publishing on it would be another part-time job. So for me to get this to work, I had to build out a publishing plan that I could do in less than an hour each day and that was simple and effective enough for me to stick to it.
  
- STEP #4: WORK YOUR WAY IN

  The next level of growth starts when you tap into your Dream 100 and their followers using the power of Instagram TV.
  
  You can do similar things when you meet your Dream 100 in real life, at conferences and events. Take a picture with them, post it to your profile tagging them, and have them post it to their profile and tag you. The possibilities are endless. Creative ideas like this are the key to working your way into the followers of your Dream 100.
  
- STEP #5: BUY YOUR WAY IN

  To quickly grow your Instagram following, you need to show up on your Dream 100’s channel. Our favorite way to buy our way in is by getting a “shout-out.” A shout-out is exactly what it sounds like it is. Basically, one of your Dream 100 posts on their profile or in their Stories about you. In their shout-out, they’ll usually mention your name, tell people to follow you, and tag you. The tag makes a clickable link on Instagram where people can click on your tag and be taken immediately to your profile, which is why it’s so important to optimize your profile page.
  
  For example, we found someone on our Dream 100 list (@prbossbabe), sent her a copy of my 30 Days book when it first came out, and paid her to do a shout-out. She posted a picture of herself with the book, told the story of the book, and then “shouted me out” by tagging me. This tag directed people back to my profile to find out more. She made this post on her profile, and she also published a few Stories with swipe-ups that took people directly to the book funnel.
  
  You can approach people in your Dream 100 to do paid shout-outs, but there are also a lot of agencies that specialize in getting shout outs for you. You can hire them, and they’ll do all the work to find the people, get you the shout out, and get people to your profile page.
  
- STEP #6: FILL YOUR FUNNEL

  The last step in this framework is to then use all this exposure and engagement to convert all of this traffic into traffic that you own. We use your Instagram profile and TV to find people and turn them into subscribers.
  
  As your following is growing, you can then start using your Instagram stories and get people to swipe up and push your followers into your funnels. You can also use our “Highlights mini webinar hack” to create mini webinars on your Highlights that will presell your people on the products or services you are selling in your funnels!
  
  The last step is to start running prospecting ads (as shown in Secret #9) to find more of your dream customers and move them into your retargeting buckets so you can get them into your funnels.
