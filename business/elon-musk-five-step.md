# 5 step process of elon musk

- 1 - Make your requirements less dumb (your reqs are definetly dumb, its particularly dangerous if a smart person makes the reqs, everyone is wrong no matter who you are at the start)
- 2 - try very hard to delete the process, if you are not occasionaly adding things back in, you are not deleting enough (iterative)
- 3 - only the third step is to simplyfy and optimize (not the first or second / this is the most common error of a smart engineer to optimize the thing that should not exist)
- 4 - accelarate cycle time, but don't go faster you worked on the other three things first
- 5 - automate
