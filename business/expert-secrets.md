## Intro

### What is Expert Secrets

- As Sir Winston Churchill once said:
  
  "To each there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing, unique to them and fitted to their talents. What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared or unqualified for that which could have been their finest hour."
  
  Your message matters, and this book is your figurative tap on the shoulder.

### Two Types of Expert Businesses

- Before we get too deep, I want to point out that there are two types of expert businesses. The tactics behind both are the same, but the strategies are a little different.

  EXPERT BUSINESS #1: SELLING INFORMATION PRODUCTS
The first type of expert business is the one that most of you will probably be creating. It involves you taking the life lessons that you’ve learned, and packaging them into information products, coaching, and consulting

  You don’t need venture or start-up capital, just a passion for what you’re teaching, as well as learning how to tell stories in a way that will get others excited about it as well.
  
  He went from having 0 followers to 100...then 1,000...and 10,000...and beyond, just by sharing what he was passionate about. This is how many expert businesses start. You find something you’re passionate about, and your obsession with learning and applying helps you become an expert who can lead others.
  
  That’s how it typically starts. We get excited about a topic and we start geeking out on it. We learn, we read books, we study examples, we listen to podcasts, and we consume a lot of information. Then we start using it for ourselves. At some point, we realize the only way to keep growing isn’t to learn more, but instead to shift our focus from personal growth to contribution. It’s only by shifting our focus to helping others that we continue to grow. We coach others, we create information products, and we start contributing to other people’s growth.
  
  EXPERT BUSINESS #2: LEVERAGING INFORMATION PRODUCTS
  
  TO GROW AN EXISTING COMPANY
If you already have a company, you can use this Expert Secrets system to quickly grow your company and get customers for free. I was hesitant to title this book “Expert Secrets”, because I didn’t want people to dismiss it simply because they sell other types of products or services besides information.

  When you start using the Expert Secrets process for your company, you’ll find that a few amazing things will happen.
  - 1. Complicated sales will become easy because the information products will indoctrinate potential customers about WHY they need your product or service.
  - 2. You will be positioned as an expert instead of a commodity, and people will pay you MORE for the same thing they could get somewhere else. All other options will become irrelevant, price resistance will disappear, and future sales will become easier.
  - 3. You will be able to acquire unlimited customers for free, so every backend sale you make will result in 100% profit.
  - 4. You’ll be able to grow MUCH faster.
  
## Creating Your Mass Movement

- I found had three things in common that helped them build a mass movement.
  - 1. They each had a charismatic leader or an attractive character. 
  - 2. Each of them focused on a future-based cause that was bigger than themselves.
  - 3. They each offered their audience a new opportunity.
  
  A creator, such as an artist, musician, photographer, craftsperson, performer, animator, designer, videomaker, or author—in other words, anyone producing works of art—needs to acquire only 1,000 True Fans to make a living. A True Fan is defined as someone who will purchase anything and everything you produce. While we’re not actually building a cult, we are consciously creating a culture of true fans.

### The Attractive Character

- Every great mass movement has a leader. You see, people become leaders when they first try to master something for themselves. Then after they’ve discovered a path for themselves, they share their knowledge with others.

  The strange thing is that often the more they do and the more people they help, the louder the voice of inadequacy becomes. Whether you’re just starting this journey or you’ve been at it for a while, just know that the biggest hurdle you’re likely to face is being okay with positioning yourself as an expert.
What’s equally important to understand is you’re not alone.

  There are people today who need what you have. And they are just waiting for you to find your voice, so you can help them change their lives. What a tragedy for them if you don’t develop your voice now.
The problem for most of us is that our unique abilities are things that come second nature to us. So they don’t seem that amazing, and we dismiss them.

  My guess is that your superpower won’t seem like that big of a deal to you either. It will be something that comes second nature. Look at what comes easy to you and what you love to geek out on, and chances are that’s where your superpower is hiding, just waiting to be developed and shared with the world.
  
  That’s the key. You don’t have to be the most knowledgeable person in the world on your topic, you just have to be one chapter ahead of the people you’re helping. There will always be people in the world who are more advanced than you. That’s fine. You can learn from them, but don’t let it stop you from helping the ones who are a chapter or two behind you.
  
- Inside these three core markets are multiple submarkets. For example, inside health you could have dozens of submarkets like diet, nutrition, strength training, and weight loss. Inside the wealth market you may have finance, investing, real estate, and sales. And the same goes for the relationships market.

  The mistake many people make today is they start looking at the niches, find one that looks good, and start building their company from there. The problem is that jumping into an existing niche is stepping into someone else’s blue ocean. And if you are the third, fourth, or fifth person in that niche, then the waters are already starting to get bloody.
  
  I suggest that you look at your submarket and try to create a new niche, a fresh blue ocean for yourself. Create a new opportunity for people so they’ll want to dive in. This is what I mean when I say you need to carve out your own spot in the ecosystem. If you jump into an already existing red ocean, you’ll be fighting an uphill battle
  
  Core market   submarket   niche
  - health -> nutrition -> high-fat-diets
  - health -> weight loss -> weight loss for college students
  - wealth -> real estate -> flipping houses on ebay
  
  Question #1: Would people in this submarket be excited about the new opportunity I’m presenting in my niche?
  
  You will be creating a new opportunity for them, and it has to be something that will make them interested enough to take action.
  
  Question #2: Are the people in this market irrationally passionate?
  
  Are YOU irrationally passionate about your topic? If so, that’s a good sign. Communities: Are there online forums and message boards and social groups dedicated to this topic? How about Facebook groups and fan pages, YouTube channels, podcasts, or blogs with others geeking out on this topic you love so much? Vocabulary: Does the market have its own special language? In the internet marketing world, you hear words like “autoresponder”, “split testing”, and “squeeze pages”. In the health and biohacking market, they talk about “blood tests” and “ketones”. An irrationally passionate market always has its own vocabulary. Does yours? Events: Does this market have its own events? They might be online or offline conferences, seminars, summits, or masterminds. If events aren’t happening in your market, you might have a hard time getting people to attend webinars and training. Other Experts: Does this market have its own celebrities and gurus? There must be established experts already thriving and selling information products in your market. You don’t want to be the first celebrity in a market. You want a topic or niche with its own subculture already established.
  
  Question #3: Are these people WILLING and ABLE to spend money on information?
  
  Sometimes people are WILLING to spend money, but they aren’t ABLE; they are broke. Other times people have all the money in the world; they are ABLE, but NOT WILLING to part with a dime. Your submarket must be both willing and able to spend money.
  
  WHO DO YOU NEED TO BECOME AS A LEADER?
  
  Jay Abraham once said that “People are silently begging to be led”
  
  Rule #1: Become an attractive character, and live the life your audience wishes they could live.
  
  That’s why it’s so important to live the life that your audience wishes they could—because that will inspire them more than anything you could ever say.
  
  Rule #2: Maintain absolute certainty.
  
  It is said that in any situation, the person with the most certainty wins. Setema Gali says: “Self-confidence is for kids.” If you want to make an impact, you have to be certain. Certainty is what draws people to leaders, to experts. Some of you are better writers, and blogging will become your platform. Others are better through audio or video, and will likely be using platforms like podcasts or Facebook Live. The platform is less important than the consistency of your sharing. It’s important to understand that when you first start, you are not posting these for your audience —you’re posting them for you.
   
  Rule #3: Don’t be boring.
   
  Your audience must be fascinated with you and what you teach. If you’re boring, they’re not going to connect with you.
  
  In the middle of the Prolific Index is the mainstream. This area contains all the ideas currently being taught to the masses in traditional mediums. For example, if you’re a weight loss expert, the mainstream advice hovers around the government recommendations for nutrition.
  
  Even if you believe those things are true, you aren’t going to get anywhere teaching mainstream advice that people are currently getting elsewhere for free. People can go to school and learn about all this stuff. It’s common sense. It’s not exciting. There’s no money in the mainstream.
  
  the most money, is right in the middle. Somewhere between the mainstream advice and the crazy zone is where you want to set yourself up. I call this place the Prolific Zone. When you’re there, you’re relaying ideas that are so unique, people will notice.
  
  When your messages cause polarity, it attracts attention and people will pay for it. Neutrality is boring, and rarely is money made or change created when you stay neutral. It’s just the nature of being a true leader. 
  
  “If you haven’t offended someone by noon each day, then you’re not marketing hard enough.” And Jay Abraham said, “If you truly believe that what you have is useful and valuable to your clients, then you have a moral obligation to try to serve them in every way possible.” And that is why I am so aggressive in my marketing. I honestly feel like I have a moral obligation to share my message, because it’s changed my life and I know it can do the same for others as well.
  
  Rule #4: Understand how to use persuasion.
  
  People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams, justify their failures, allay their fears, confirm their suspicions, and help them throw rocks at their enemies.

  Encourage their dreams. As the leader, it’s vital that you first understand your audience’s dreams Parents often discourage their children’s dreams “for their own good” and attempt to steer them toward more “reasonable” goals. Justify their failures. Most people who become followers and then fans will have tried to make a change before. You will not be the first person they have tried to learn from. For some reason, they didn’t get their needs met from any prior encounters. It’s important that you take the blame for past failures off their shoulders Allay their fears. To allay is to diminish or put to rest. If you can put their fears to rest and give them hope, they will follow you to the ends of the Earth and back again. When we are afraid, it is almost impossible to concentrate on anything else. Confirm their suspicions. Your audience is already suspicious of you and others in your market. They want to believe change is possible. But they’re skeptical about making the leap forward. When you can confirm in story format that you had similar suspicions and describe how you overcame them, it will bond people to you. Throw rocks at their enemies. One big key to growing your following is creating “Us vs. Them” within your community. Nothing bonds like having a common enemy.  Those who don’t understand it, or worse, understand but refuse to address it, are throwing away one of the most effective ways of connecting with others.
  
  Rule #5: Care...a LOT.
  
  The next part of being a charismatic leader is showing people that you actually care about them. There’s an old saying that goes, “They don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” If your audience thinks you are just in this to make money, your vehicle for change will not last long.  Yes, those who pay, pay attention—and the more they pay, the closer attention they pay. You are actually doing your audience a huge disservice if you undervalue what you are selling.
  
  Rule #6: Offer them value from their perceived relationship with you.
  
  They’ve subscribed to your list, they read your blog and listen to your podcast— they’re hearing from you all the time. They want to see some sort of value in return for the time they are spending with you. But that’s not always how they define the value they want to get. Sometimes they just want to be part of a community. Sometimes they just want to get to know you. Some people love to consume and learn, and that’s how they feel they get value. We can’t push our definition of value on them. We have to allow them to feel that in the way THEY define. If you try to force “success” as you see it on them when they really just want to be part of your community or they just love learning, it’s easy to alienate people from your tribe. They have to get value as they define it.
  
### The Cause

- As I mentioned before, my Inner Circle mastermind group spends a lot of time talking about building out your own CULTure. I hyphenated the word because I don’t want you to look at this like a traditional business trying to build a customer culture. They’re very different.

  “Fear of the future causes us to lean against and cling to the present, while faith in the future renders us perceptive to change.” In circumstances where people fear the future, they typically stop moving forward. For you to have success in this business, you have to give your followers hope of something better so they will be perceptive to the change you are going to offer them. 
  
  Here are a few key principles that will help you create your future-based cause.
  - 1. Where can they place their hope and faith? I realized that not only rebellions but all mass movements are built on hope, and it’s essential that we create that hope in the future, because without hope, they can’t have the faith necessary to move forward and change. As they say in Proverbs 29:18: “Where there is no vision, the people perish.”
  - 2. Help Them Break Their 4-Minute Mile - certainty people get when they see someone else do something they thought was impossible, gives them the belief they need to also achieve that same goal. Your focus will be taken off of you making money, and into giving results to others, and for some odd reason, as soon as you make that shift in your thinking, almost instantly you’ll start making more money.
  - 3. Let Them Self-Identify. Now that you’ve helped people to see the vision of where you are taking them, the next goal is to get them to identify with your movement. People need to be able to identify with who they are in your
group, or there will be no connection with you or the other members.

  When someone joins you, they need to be able to identify by saying, “I’m a __________.” When they can do that, they have an identity shift, which is very important. They get a new identity as part of the group.
  
  To get people to identify with your movement, come up with something simple that you can put on a t-shirt your members could wear that would make them identify with your movement. Think “I’m a __________” or “I __________.”
    - I’m a Funnel Hacker.
    - I’m a Lady Boss.
    - I build funnels.
    - I see things differently.
    - I’m a biohacker.
 - 4. Create your own Title of Liberty. - Your culture needs a Title of Liberty. Something they can look at when they’re feeling doubtful—a rallying call. Something that will help them know who YOU are, remind them who THEY are, and refocus them on where you are going together.

### The New Opporunity

- The last piece of the puzzle you need to create your movement is something I
call the New Opportunity, or the vehicle for change that you are offering to people. This is by far the most important, yet least understood, part of the process. The difference between having some modest success and changing the world comes down to understanding and implementing the new opportunity.

  Our goal is not to fix what’s not working. Our goal is to REPLACE what’s not working with something better.
  
  WHY PEOPLE DON’T WANT IMPROVEMENT OFFERS
  
  Improvement offers are much harder to sell for a lot of reasons.
  - 1. Improvement is Hard Most people have tried to improve in the past, and for some reason it didn’t work. They’ve tried to lose weight. They’ve tried to make money. They’ve tried to make their relationships better. But if they’re coming to you, then whatever they tried in the past didn’t work for some reason. With a new opportunity, they don’t know what the process will be, so they don’t have to go through the known pain to get the result.
  - 2. Desire vs. Ambition All people have desire, but very few have ambition. My guess is that less than 2% of the population is actually ambitious. Improvement offers are selling to over- achieving ambitious people. If you do sell an improvement offer, you are automatically excluding 98% of the world. You will be fighting an uphill battle.
  - 3. Memories of Poor Past Decisions If your followers are in need of improvement, they must first admit failure. In order for them to say yes to your offer, they have to admit that the choices they made in the past were wrong.
  - 4. Commodity Pricing When you are selling improvement, you are selling against dozens or hundreds of other improvement offers out there. You are stuck in the middle of a very red ocean, competing with everyone else selling similar options. This competition turns what you do into a commodity and pushes the pricing down. It quickly becomes a race to the bottom in terms of pricing.
  
  Dan Kennedy once told me, “If you can’t be the #1 lowest price leader in your market, there is no strategic advantage in being the #2 lowest price leader.” In other words, if you can’t be the cheapest, then you need to become the most expensive. And you can’t do that when you are fighting inside of this red ocean. When you present a new opportunity, you are creating a blue ocean, and all price resistance goes out the window. The #1 reason people don’t want improvement, and the reason they will or won’t join your culture is STATUS.
 
- STATUS: THE ONLY THING THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO MOVE (OR NOT MOVE)

  That’s it. STATUS is the magic word in this business. When someone is presented with an opportunity, their subconscious mind is working on the answer to this question: Is this thing I’m considering going to increase my status or decrease it?
  
  Status as I’m defining it here has nothing to do with how other people perceive you, but rather with how you perceive yourself.
Almost every choice in your life has revolved around status—whether you know it or not.

  If your brain thinks that taking an action will reverse your status, then you won’t do it—UNLESS it finds hope that by temporarily decreasing your status, you could increase it in the future.
  
  People are going to weigh the likelihood of success and elevated status against the risk of failure and the cost of that failure. Your job as the expert is to load up the elevated status side of the scale and decrease the risk of failure. You can do that by creating an amazing product and minimizing risk with things like money-back guarantees, risk reversals, and done-for-you options. The key to making a sale is 100% tied to this concept of status.
  
  And so you can probably see why that is the BIGGEST reason why we don’t sell improvement offers. For someone to say yes to that, they have to admit to poor past decisions and create a huge decrease in status. Then you are forced to fight an uphill battle that few people ever win. So which factors elevate status? Well, it’s different for everyone, but here are a few that are pretty universal.
  - Appearance of intelligence (anything that makes them look smarter)
  - Appearance of wealth, power, or happiness
  - Physical appearance (weight loss, makeup, supplements, etc.)
  - Style (think Mac vs. PC)
  
  Now you might be thinking, “I’m not affected by status considerations. I like to drive a reasonable car and live in a modest home.” If so, I’d like to pose a question. Why? Why do you like driving a car you feel is reasonably priced? Does it have anything to do with the fact that if you drove a Ferrari home one day, you’re afraid that your friends, family, or neighbors would judge you? If they did judge you, how would that affect your status?
  
  Status works on both ends of the spectrum. It’s what makes some people fight for earthly possessions, and it’s also what keeps others from desiring them at all. As much as we may hate to admit it, we are all slaves to what we believe other people will think about us.
    
- WHY PEOPLE CRAVE NEW OPPORTUNITIES

  So now you know why improvement offers don’t work. Here are a few reasons why new opportunities DO work.
  - 1. New discovery When people discover your new opportunity for the first time, they’re going to want to share it because sharing something new gives them an immediate increase in status
  - 2. No pain of disconnect Because they don’t have to admit they made bad decisions in the past, there is no longer a huge pain of disconnect from what they are currently doing. No pain of disconnect = no decrease in status.
  - 3. Dream replacement One reason many people struggle to make the changes they want and need in their lives is the fear of failure. If they try to change and it doesn’t work for them, then their dreams are dead. So they will give up potential success for fear of losing their dreams. We know that “without a vision, the people perish”. When you make a new opportunity, you’re giving them a new dream to move toward.
  - 4. Greener pastures We’ve all heard a million times that “the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence”, right? Instead of trying to convince people that their grass is green or offering to fix their grass, allow them to follow you to the other side of the fence.
  
  CREATING THE NEW OPPORTUNITY, THEIR VEHICLE FOR CHANGE

  While there are lots of ways to structure improvement offers, there are only two ways to position a new opportunity, either as an Opportunity Switch or an Opportunity Stack.
  
  Opportunity Switching Each of our prospects has a desire for some result, and they have been trying to get that result through some vehicle. Maybe they are trying to lose weight, and the vehicle they have currently chosen to lose weight is the Atkins diet. So my opportunity switch is to take them out of the vehicle they’re currently using and put them into a new one. So in this example I could switch them from Atkins to something new, like the Paleo diet. If the Paleo diet has become a red ocean with lots of people teaching it, then it is no longer a new opportunity, and I need to create my own sub-niche like we discussed in Secret #1.
  
  Other times it’s actually switching them from one submarket to another. For example, maybe they are moving from making an income in real estate, to making their income through internet marketing.

  Opportunity Stacking After someone has made the switch into your new opportunity, then all future sales to that prospect are typically an opportunity stack, not an improvement offer. I don’t want to switch my prospects from opportunity to opportunity because it will cause confusion and break trust. But I can offer them an opportunity stack within the new opportunity that they have just joined.
  
  I am trying to switch the career paths that you’ve been following up to this point (your current job, school, real estate, stock markets, or other ways to generate wealth). My goal is to help you see this new opportunity of becoming an expert and having a mass following who will pay you for your advice, and if I do my job right, you will make that switch into a career as an expert.
  
  After you’ve decided to make that opportunity switch, then I will look for the other new opportunities within this opportunity that I can offer that will help to serve you at a higher level. 
  
  Some people never hear about this book, but they do find out about ClickFunnels or my certification program. When that’s the case, that offer becomes the opportunity switch.

### The Opportunity Switch

- So far, we’ve discussed the strategy for building a strong foundation so you can
become a leader people will follow. You’ve chosen a niche you want to create. Notice that I didn’t say “pick a niche”. It’s essential for you to create a NEW niche, a NEW opportunity for your people.
  
  In the beginning stages of your expert career, you won’t be good—and that’s okay. As my good friend, Garret White, once said: No matter what you do, in the beginning it’s going to suck, because you suck. But you’ll get better, and you’ll suck less. And as you keep doing this, eventually you’ll suck so little...you’ll actually be good. But you can’t get good unless you start NOW.
  - 1. What is the RESULT you want for your people?
  - 2. What is the VEHICLE or process you are going to take them through to get that result?
  
  Once you know those two things on a basic level, you can move forward and design the perfect vehicle that your audience will love.
  
  STEP #1: GET EARLY RESULTS BY WORKING FOR FREE
  
  So Alec spent a couple of hours folding clothes and sweeping up, just
generally helping out. When he was done, he said, “Thanks so much,” and he left. Everyone at the store was kind of confused, but they were grateful for the helping hand.

  The next day, Alec came back to the store and started folding clothes again. He spent another two or three hours helping these guys out. Then when he was done at the end of the day, he thanked everybody and started walking out. The manager stopped him and asked, “Do you want a job?” My friend smiled and said, “Sure, I’d love one.” And they hired him on the spot.

  This is a perfect example of working for free to get a result. Alec could have tried to sell himself to the manager, but instead he proved his worth first. And he got hired in less time than it would have taken to fill out an application and wade through the interview process.

  The goal with this or any kind of business is not to lead with “How can I sell my product?” Instead, you want to ask, “How can I serve people? How can I prove my stuff works? How can I get results for somebody else?” Those results are going to sell your products and services.
  
  STEP #2: DESIGN THE VEHICLE (YOUR NEW OPPORTUNITY)
  
  The next questions are where do you find people to serve, and what should you create to teach them?  This process gets the results that you can then build an empire on. You’re going to deliver a six-week opportunity switch masterclass. I’ve found that six weeks is the optimum amount of time. Any less than that, and you run the risk of people wanting refunds Any longer than that, and people will start complaining because they feel like it’s never going to end.
  
  I know we’re not selling anything yet, but this beta masterclass will become the core curriculum for the people who will be paying you soon, so it’s important to set it up in the same way that others will experience it in the future.
The next step is to begin building some of the marketing materials for the class. I know that seems backward. Most people design the class first and then think about marketing, but that is a formula for disaster.

  Who / What Statement As a first step, I like to make a Who / What statement that quickly addresses which submarket my message is for, and what new opportunity they will be switching to “I am going to teach real estate investors how to make money flipping houses on eBay.”
  
  The Opportunity Switch Headline Now that you know the WHO and WHAT, you need to give the class a sexy title that will attract your dream customers. How to [result they desire most] Without [thing they fear most]
  
  The 5 Curiosity Hooks / Getting Out of The Red Ocean Okay, you’ve written down WHO you’re going to serve and WHAT the vehicle is. Next you need to make that new opportunity as sexy and exciting as possible. You have to figure out the big idea that will draw people to you. Why would they shift from the current vehicle they’re in to yours? They will switch if you position your opportunity so people will believe—and buy.
  
  A while back, one of my friends named Jason Fladlien taught me a concept
called the five curiosity hooks. These are just different ways to present an opportunity.

  1. Little-Known, Big Differences This hook shows people something they aren’t aware of and how knowing it could make all the difference between success and failure.
  
  2. Well Known, Little Understood Here is where you take something that everyone THINKS they know about, and show how they’re actually sabotaging their success because they’re missing little nuances or details.
  
  3. This Changes Everything With this hook, something new has just
happened in your submarket. It’s related to the problem your audience wants to solve, and letting them know that if they aren’t aware of it, they’re at risk of missing out big-time.

  4. The Crystal Ball Theory This angle shows how something that’s been done successfully in the past is about to be made obsolete. You’re persuading them that soon this will be common knowledge, but they can get in now and have early success.
  
  5. Revisiting the Fundamentals This hook takes the approach that things are getting way too complicated, advanced, or sophisticated for the average person. Your new opportunity, on the other hand, takes things back to basics.
  
  Those are the five curiosity hooks. You’ll probably notice that each one is speaking AGAINST a current red-ocean tactic that currently exists in the marketplace.
  
  STEP #3: GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT (THE ASK CAMPAIGN)
  
  At this point, it’s important to remember that people don’t buy what they need, they buy what they want. All too often we create a new opportunity giving people exactly what they need, a vehicle that is capable of getting them to their end result. But when they get into the vehicle, they don’t see what they actually WANTED, like air conditioning, leather seats, radio options, etc. Because of that, they will leave before they ever give you a chance to take them to the result they really desire.
  
  You accomplish this by running a simple one-question survey we call an “Ask Campaign”. The Ask Campaign is based on a simple three-step formula. This technique is SO simple, but don’t skip it because of its simplicity. It’s one of the most important steps.
  - 1. Find a hot market.
  - 2. Ask them what they want.
  - 3. Give it to them.
  
  Because we’re the experts in our respective niches, it’s easy to assume we know what people want. And while sometimes we may be right, more often we miss the mark. (Probably because we are so close to our own ideas.)
  
  It sounds strange, but that’s where I start every time I’m creating a brand-new niche. I post it on Facebook. I text my friends and family members. I try to get everyone I know to come to my very first masterclass. That’s the low-hanging fruit.
  
  Using the survey data Run traffic to the Ask Campaign page until you have about 100 responses. Out of those 100, you’re going to find 8 to 10 core questions people are asking over and over. Those questions will become the titles of the modules in your masterclass. After you have the questions and the outline, there’s one more step that.
  
  STEP #4: DELIVER YOUR FREE MASTERCLASS
  
  To make running your first masterclass simple, you really only need two tools— a Facebook group and Facebook Live (both free!). Set up a private Facebook group so your beta members can interact with each other. A group allows you to post content, give class updates, provide accountability, and deliver any bonuses.
  
  After you’ve completed your masterclass and have some great results that prove what you can do for people. That’s the goal from this first section. The results you get from this beta group will become the fuel that grows your expert business.
  
## Creating Belief

- The longer I work in this business, the more I realize how everything comes down to one thing—belief. Belief creates the customer. Belief creates the results. You must persuade people to believe in what you are doing, and you do that by mastering the art of storytelling

### The Big Domino

- Perry Belcher. He told me how he had gone back and analyzed all the different offers that his companies had created and sold over the past 10 years.
He discovered that the more things they asked someone to believe in their sales pitch, the worse the offer converted. In fact, he figured out that if they tried to make more than ONE point or ask someone to focus on more than ONE thing in a sales message, conversion rates dropped by half! He then said, “Look at how many things a prospect has to believe in order to buy what you’re selling. If it’s more than one, you need to rework your sales presentation.”

  If A then B:
  
  We see this happening everywhere around us from politics to sports to the people we spend time with. That’s why it’s hard to have an argument with someone about something they truly believe in. When that seed of belief is there, it doesn’t matter how much you try to convince them otherwise, it has already knocked down all the other smaller dominos that you’re trying to stack back up.
  
  The One Thing, aka The Big Domino Statement
  
  If I can make people believe that (my new opportunity) is are key to (what they desire most) and is are only attainable through (my specific vehicle), then all other objections and concerns become irrelevant and they have to give me money.

### The Epiphany Bridge

- So what is an Epiphany Bridge? It’s simply a story that takes people through the emotional experience that got YOU excited about the new opportunity you’re presenting to them. The first time I learned about funnels, I had an epiphany. We’re having these little “aha” moments all the time.

  The first time you discovered your expert topic, SOMETHING happened that excited you. You had an emotional response that sold you on this new opportunity. Do you remember what the experience was? Do you remember how you felt?
  
  That first “aha” moment created so much excitement for you that you started on a journey where you studied everything you could find about the topic. You started geeking out and going deep into the subject, learning all the terminology and understanding the science and technical aspects behind why it worked, and then you became logically sold on the new opportunity.
  
  Now at this point you’ve had an emotional connection with the new opportunity as well as a logical connection.
  
  But unfortunately for you, the first thing you try to do is logically convince everyone you know about this new idea.
  
  The problem is that you started to speak a language we call “technobabble”.
  
  We talk about how we’re “leading the industry” with “ground-breaking” products. We share industry numbers and jargon.
But all the logical stuff that strengthened our own beliefs in the new opportunity will not help people buy unless they’ve ALREADY HAD THE SAME INITIAL EMOTIONAL EPIPHANY that you had. All the logic, features, and benefits you give people before the epiphany will just annoy them. It’s frustrating and often completely offensive. There’s a time and a place for logic, but you have to convince them emotionally first, before they’ll be excited by your logic. 

  If you think about it, there’s a status consideration on BOTH sides of this equation. I’m emotionally attached to the status that the new Ferrari will give me, but then I need to justify it logically to my friends and family so I don’t lose status in their minds.
  
  Logic doesn’t sell. Emotions sell.
  
  That story—your Epiphany Bridge story—provides the emotional connection, and bridges the gap from the emotional to the logical side.
If you can tell a story about how you got your big “aha”, and if you structure the story right, they will have the same epiphany and will sell themselves on your product or service.

  I want you to think back to the original experience that gave you your first epiphany, that brought you on this journey. Do you remember what happened? What was happening around you? How did you feel? It’s important to remember those details, because they are the key to telling a good story.
  
- EFFECTIVE STORYTELLING

  The first key to telling captivating stories is oversimplification. When you’re telling stories, you need to speak at about a third-grade level. Many of you will struggle with this because you like to use big words and show off your vocabulary and try to sound sophisticated and smart. There may be a time and a place for that, but it’s not when you’re telling stories.
  
  Using big words may make you feel smarter, but it will not influence others.
But sometimes you have to talk about complex ideas. So how do you take a complicated idea and simplify it quickly? You do this using a tool I created called a “kinda like” bridge. Every time I run into a word or a concept that is past a third-grade level, I stop and think about how I can relate that concept to something they already know and understand

  I take this new concept or word that people may not understand and add the phrase “it’s kinda like...” to the sentence. I’m connecting the new word or concept to something they already understand.
  
  HOW DOES IT FEEL?
  
  The next way to improve your storytelling is to add in feelings and emotions.
  
   If you look at a good fiction author, they’ll have the character come into a room, then spend several pages describing the room. They talk about the lights, how things looked and felt, and everything they need to set up the scene. Then they go deep into how the character is feeling. And that is the key. You have to explain how you feel, and when you do that, people will start to feel what you were feeling.
   
   By explaining how I felt, you almost instantly will feel something similar. When I tell a story this way, I am controlling the state of the person listening.

### The Hero Two Journey

- I want to walk you through what I learned from The Hero’s 2 Journeys. It will give you context for what a good story needs to be, and will help you craft your Epiphany Bridge stories.

  Good stories are really simple. There can be layers of complexity, but at the core they are all very simple. Depending on the complexities I share, I can tell the same story in 60 seconds or 60 minutes—all with the same desired effect.
Every good story is built on three foundational elements (Character, Desire and Conflict), also known as “the plot.”

  Once upon a time, there was a girl named Red Riding Hood. She wanted to take a basket of cookies to her grandma, who lived in the woods. What she didn’t know was that the big, bad wolf was waiting to gobble her up.
  - Character: Red Riding Hood , Desire: Take a basket of cookies to her grandma, Conflict: big, bad wolf
  
  Michael explained, “Every good story is about a captivating character who is pursuing some compelling desire and who faces seemingly insurmountable obstacles to achieving it. 
  
  Your Plot Statement The first Epiphany Bridge story you will tell is the one that got you excited about your new opportunity in the first place. You are the character, so that step is easy. But what desire started you on your journey? What did you want to achieve? Write it down. Next, what was the conflict you experienced along the way? Write it down. Boom! You’ve got a plot.
  
  - 1 - Build rapport with the hero: (Make the character a victim of some outside force, so we want to root for them., Put the character in jeopardy, so we worry about them., Make the character likable, so we want to be with them., Make the character funny, so we connect with them., Make the character powerful, so we want to be like them.) Sharing flaws is critical to gaining rapport. No one cares about Superman until we introduce kryptonite.
  - 2 - Introduce the desire for something more. (Every story is about a journey either toward pleasure or away from pain.  There are four core desires that drive most heroes. Two of them move the hero toward pleasure, and two move away from pain.)
  
    Toward Pleasure (To Win The hero may be trying to win the heart of someone they love, or they may want to win fame, money, a competition, or prestige., To Retrieve The hero wants to obtain something and bring it back.)

    Away From Pain (To Escape The hero desires to get away from something that’s upsetting or causing pain., To Stop The hero wants to stop some bad thing from happening.)

    But in all good stories, the hero is actually on two journeys—the one that everyone sees (The Journey of Achievement), and one that’s hidden (The Journey of Transformation). The second journey may not be as obvious, yet it’s the key to the whole story.

    The Journey of Achievement -- This is the first journey, the one that everyone listening to the story is aware of. There’s a visible goal with a finish line that everyone can see. While this journey is what drives the story forward, it’s the second journey that actually matters the most. In fact, in many stories, the hero never actually achieves his end desire. 

    The Journey of Transformation -- During the first 10% of the story, we learn about the character and the beliefs they have that make up their identity. A particular identity is very important to the hero at the beginning of the story, but along the way they become someone else, someone better.
   - 3 - Introduce the conflict. (Desire is essential to the story because it shows the end goal. It provides a reason for the journey to move forward. But emotion doesn’t come from the desire. It comes from the conflict the hero faces while trying to gain the desire.) There are five turning points that create the emotion in almost all films.
   
    1) The New Opportunity After you share the character’s backstory, some event causes the character to physically leave where they are and start the journey.
    
    2) Change of Plans At some point, the original desire will transform into a very specific, visible goal with a clearly defined end point. This is where the hero’s outer motivation is revealed.
    
    3) Point of No Return At this point, the hero must fully commit to reaching the goal. Up to this point, they’ve had opportunities to turn back. But something happens here that makes this a do-or- die situation. It’s no longer a should; it’s a must.
    
    4) The Major Setback Something happens to the hero, and we believe that all is lost. This event initially leaves the hero with no chance of success, but then we see a small glimmer of light. The hero has only one option. He has to take one last all-or-nothing shot at the desire.
    
    5) The Climax Now our hero must face the biggest obstacle of the entire story and determine their own fate. The journey of achievement will be resolved once and for all, and the journey of transformation will be revealed. Then we move into the aftermath of the story—the hero’s new life is revealed, and the journey is complete.

### The Epiphany Bridge Script

- The Epiphany Bridge script follows a similar path as the hero’s two journeys, but I built it in a way that makes telling your stories very simple. You’ll be telling a lot of stories, so mastering this script will become one of the most important things you could ever do.

  An Epiphany Bridge story has eight core sections that pull you through the hero’s two journeys. I have a question that goes with each section, and answering each question actually creates the story for me. 
  - 1. The Backstory: What is your backstory that gives us a vested interest in your journey?
  - 2. Your Desires: What is it you want to accomplish? (a. External: What is the external struggle you are dealing with?, b. Internal: What is the internal struggle you are dealing with?)
  - 3. The Wall: What was the wall or problem you hit within your current opportunity that started you on this new journey?
  - 4. The Epiphany: What was the epiphany you experienced and new opportunity you discovered?
  - 5. The Plan: What was the plan you created to achieve your desire?
  - 6. The Conflict: What conflict did you experience along the way?
  - 7. The Achievement: What was your end result?
  - 8. The Transformation: What was the transformation you experienced?
  
  For many of you, that outline and those questions will be enough to give you the framework to tell any story.
