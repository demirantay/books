## Intro

### What is Expert Secrets

- As Sir Winston Churchill once said:
  
  "To each there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing, unique to them and fitted to their talents. What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared or unqualified for that which could have been their finest hour."
  
  Your message matters, and this book is your figurative tap on the shoulder.

### Two Types of Expert Businesses

- Before we get too deep, I want to point out that there are two types of expert businesses. The tactics behind both are the same, but the strategies are a little different.

  EXPERT BUSINESS #1: SELLING INFORMATION PRODUCTS
The first type of expert business is the one that most of you will probably be creating. It involves you taking the life lessons that you’ve learned, and packaging them into information products, coaching, and consulting

  You don’t need venture or start-up capital, just a passion for what you’re teaching, as well as learning how to tell stories in a way that will get others excited about it as well.
  
  He went from having 0 followers to 100...then 1,000...and 10,000...and beyond, just by sharing what he was passionate about. This is how many expert businesses start. You find something you’re passionate about, and your obsession with learning and applying helps you become an expert who can lead others.
  
  That’s how it typically starts. We get excited about a topic and we start geeking out on it. We learn, we read books, we study examples, we listen to podcasts, and we consume a lot of information. Then we start using it for ourselves. At some point, we realize the only way to keep growing isn’t to learn more, but instead to shift our focus from personal growth to contribution. It’s only by shifting our focus to helping others that we continue to grow. We coach others, we create information products, and we start contributing to other people’s growth.
  
  EXPERT BUSINESS #2: LEVERAGING INFORMATION PRODUCTS
  
  TO GROW AN EXISTING COMPANY
If you already have a company, you can use this Expert Secrets system to quickly grow your company and get customers for free. I was hesitant to title this book “Expert Secrets”, because I didn’t want people to dismiss it simply because they sell other types of products or services besides information.

  When you start using the Expert Secrets process for your company, you’ll find that a few amazing things will happen.
  - 1. Complicated sales will become easy because the information products will indoctrinate potential customers about WHY they need your product or service.
  - 2. You will be positioned as an expert instead of a commodity, and people will pay you MORE for the same thing they could get somewhere else. All other options will become irrelevant, price resistance will disappear, and future sales will become easier.
  - 3. You will be able to acquire unlimited customers for free, so every backend sale you make will result in 100% profit.
  - 4. You’ll be able to grow MUCH faster.
  
## Creating Your Mass Movement

- I found had three things in common that helped them build a mass movement.
  - 1. They each had a charismatic leader or an attractive character. 
  - 2. Each of them focused on a future-based cause that was bigger than themselves.
  - 3. They each offered their audience a new opportunity.
  
  A creator, such as an artist, musician, photographer, craftsperson, performer, animator, designer, videomaker, or author—in other words, anyone producing works of art—needs to acquire only 1,000 True Fans to make a living. A True Fan is defined as someone who will purchase anything and everything you produce. While we’re not actually building a cult, we are consciously creating a culture of true fans.

### The Attractive Character

- Every great mass movement has a leader. You see, people become leaders when they first try to master something for themselves. Then after they’ve discovered a path for themselves, they share their knowledge with others.

  The strange thing is that often the more they do and the more people they help, the louder the voice of inadequacy becomes. Whether you’re just starting this journey or you’ve been at it for a while, just know that the biggest hurdle you’re likely to face is being okay with positioning yourself as an expert.
What’s equally important to understand is you’re not alone.

  There are people today who need what you have. And they are just waiting for you to find your voice, so you can help them change their lives. What a tragedy for them if you don’t develop your voice now.
The problem for most of us is that our unique abilities are things that come second nature to us. So they don’t seem that amazing, and we dismiss them.

  My guess is that your superpower won’t seem like that big of a deal to you either. It will be something that comes second nature. Look at what comes easy to you and what you love to geek out on, and chances are that’s where your superpower is hiding, just waiting to be developed and shared with the world.
  
  That’s the key. You don’t have to be the most knowledgeable person in the world on your topic, you just have to be one chapter ahead of the people you’re helping. There will always be people in the world who are more advanced than you. That’s fine. You can learn from them, but don’t let it stop you from helping the ones who are a chapter or two behind you.
  
- Inside these three core markets are multiple submarkets. For example, inside health you could have dozens of submarkets like diet, nutrition, strength training, and weight loss. Inside the wealth market you may have finance, investing, real estate, and sales. And the same goes for the relationships market.

  The mistake many people make today is they start looking at the niches, find one that looks good, and start building their company from there. The problem is that jumping into an existing niche is stepping into someone else’s blue ocean. And if you are the third, fourth, or fifth person in that niche, then the waters are already starting to get bloody.
  
  I suggest that you look at your submarket and try to create a new niche, a fresh blue ocean for yourself. Create a new opportunity for people so they’ll want to dive in. This is what I mean when I say you need to carve out your own spot in the ecosystem. If you jump into an already existing red ocean, you’ll be fighting an uphill battle
  
  Core market   submarket   niche
  - health -> nutrition -> high-fat-diets
  - health -> weight loss -> weight loss for college students
  - wealth -> real estate -> flipping houses on ebay
  
  Question #1: Would people in this submarket be excited about the new opportunity I’m presenting in my niche?
  
  You will be creating a new opportunity for them, and it has to be something that will make them interested enough to take action.
  
  Question #2: Are the people in this market irrationally passionate?
  
  Are YOU irrationally passionate about your topic? If so, that’s a good sign. Communities: Are there online forums and message boards and social groups dedicated to this topic? How about Facebook groups and fan pages, YouTube channels, podcasts, or blogs with others geeking out on this topic you love so much? Vocabulary: Does the market have its own special language? In the internet marketing world, you hear words like “autoresponder”, “split testing”, and “squeeze pages”. In the health and biohacking market, they talk about “blood tests” and “ketones”. An irrationally passionate market always has its own vocabulary. Does yours? Events: Does this market have its own events? They might be online or offline conferences, seminars, summits, or masterminds. If events aren’t happening in your market, you might have a hard time getting people to attend webinars and training. Other Experts: Does this market have its own celebrities and gurus? There must be established experts already thriving and selling information products in your market. You don’t want to be the first celebrity in a market. You want a topic or niche with its own subculture already established.
  
  Question #3: Are these people WILLING and ABLE to spend money on information?
  
  Sometimes people are WILLING to spend money, but they aren’t ABLE; they are broke. Other times people have all the money in the world; they are ABLE, but NOT WILLING to part with a dime. Your submarket must be both willing and able to spend money.
  
  WHO DO YOU NEED TO BECOME AS A LEADER?
  
  Jay Abraham once said that “People are silently begging to be led”
  
  Rule #1: Become an attractive character, and live the life your audience wishes they could live.
  
  That’s why it’s so important to live the life that your audience wishes they could—because that will inspire them more than anything you could ever say.
  
  Rule #2: Maintain absolute certainty.
  
  It is said that in any situation, the person with the most certainty wins. Setema Gali says: “Self-confidence is for kids.” If you want to make an impact, you have to be certain. Certainty is what draws people to leaders, to experts. Some of you are better writers, and blogging will become your platform. Others are better through audio or video, and will likely be using platforms like podcasts or Facebook Live. The platform is less important than the consistency of your sharing. It’s important to understand that when you first start, you are not posting these for your audience —you’re posting them for you.
   
  Rule #3: Don’t be boring.
   
  Your audience must be fascinated with you and what you teach. If you’re boring, they’re not going to connect with you.
  
  In the middle of the Prolific Index is the mainstream. This area contains all the ideas currently being taught to the masses in traditional mediums. For example, if you’re a weight loss expert, the mainstream advice hovers around the government recommendations for nutrition.
  
  Even if you believe those things are true, you aren’t going to get anywhere teaching mainstream advice that people are currently getting elsewhere for free. People can go to school and learn about all this stuff. It’s common sense. It’s not exciting. There’s no money in the mainstream.
  
  the most money, is right in the middle. Somewhere between the mainstream advice and the crazy zone is where you want to set yourself up. I call this place the Prolific Zone. When you’re there, you’re relaying ideas that are so unique, people will notice.
  
  When your messages cause polarity, it attracts attention and people will pay for it. Neutrality is boring, and rarely is money made or change created when you stay neutral. It’s just the nature of being a true leader. 
  
  “If you haven’t offended someone by noon each day, then you’re not marketing hard enough.” And Jay Abraham said, “If you truly believe that what you have is useful and valuable to your clients, then you have a moral obligation to try to serve them in every way possible.” And that is why I am so aggressive in my marketing. I honestly feel like I have a moral obligation to share my message, because it’s changed my life and I know it can do the same for others as well.
  
  Rule #4: Understand how to use persuasion.
  
  People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams, justify their failures, allay their fears, confirm their suspicions, and help them throw rocks at their enemies.

  Encourage their dreams. As the leader, it’s vital that you first understand your audience’s dreams Parents often discourage their children’s dreams “for their own good” and attempt to steer them toward more “reasonable” goals. Justify their failures. Most people who become followers and then fans will have tried to make a change before. You will not be the first person they have tried to learn from. For some reason, they didn’t get their needs met from any prior encounters. It’s important that you take the blame for past failures off their shoulders Allay their fears. To allay is to diminish or put to rest. If you can put their fears to rest and give them hope, they will follow you to the ends of the Earth and back again. When we are afraid, it is almost impossible to concentrate on anything else. Confirm their suspicions. Your audience is already suspicious of you and others in your market. They want to believe change is possible. But they’re skeptical about making the leap forward. When you can confirm in story format that you had similar suspicions and describe how you overcame them, it will bond people to you. Throw rocks at their enemies. One big key to growing your following is creating “Us vs. Them” within your community. Nothing bonds like having a common enemy.  Those who don’t understand it, or worse, understand but refuse to address it, are throwing away one of the most effective ways of connecting with others.
  
  Rule #5: Care...a LOT.
  
  The next part of being a charismatic leader is showing people that you actually care about them. There’s an old saying that goes, “They don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” If your audience thinks you are just in this to make money, your vehicle for change will not last long.  Yes, those who pay, pay attention—and the more they pay, the closer attention they pay. You are actually doing your audience a huge disservice if you undervalue what you are selling.
  
  Rule #6: Offer them value from their perceived relationship with you.
  
  They’ve subscribed to your list, they read your blog and listen to your podcast— they’re hearing from you all the time. They want to see some sort of value in return for the time they are spending with you. But that’s not always how they define the value they want to get. Sometimes they just want to be part of a community. Sometimes they just want to get to know you. Some people love to consume and learn, and that’s how they feel they get value. We can’t push our definition of value on them. We have to allow them to feel that in the way THEY define. If you try to force “success” as you see it on them when they really just want to be part of your community or they just love learning, it’s easy to alienate people from your tribe. They have to get value as they define it.
  
### The Cause

- As I mentioned before, my Inner Circle mastermind group spends a lot of time talking about building out your own CULTure. I hyphenated the word because I don’t want you to look at this like a traditional business trying to build a customer culture. They’re very different.

  “Fear of the future causes us to lean against and cling to the present, while faith in the future renders us perceptive to change.” In circumstances where people fear the future, they typically stop moving forward. For you to have success in this business, you have to give your followers hope of something better so they will be perceptive to the change you are going to offer them. 
  
  Here are a few key principles that will help you create your future-based cause.
  - 1. Where can they place their hope and faith? I realized that not only rebellions but all mass movements are built on hope, and it’s essential that we create that hope in the future, because without hope, they can’t have the faith necessary to move forward and change. As they say in Proverbs 29:18: “Where there is no vision, the people perish.”
  - 2. Help Them Break Their 4-Minute Mile - certainty people get when they see someone else do something they thought was impossible, gives them the belief they need to also achieve that same goal. Your focus will be taken off of you making money, and into giving results to others, and for some odd reason, as soon as you make that shift in your thinking, almost instantly you’ll start making more money.
  - 3. Let Them Self-Identify. Now that you’ve helped people to see the vision of where you are taking them, the next goal is to get them to identify with your movement. People need to be able to identify with who they are in your
group, or there will be no connection with you or the other members.

  When someone joins you, they need to be able to identify by saying, “I’m a __________.” When they can do that, they have an identity shift, which is very important. They get a new identity as part of the group.
  
  To get people to identify with your movement, come up with something simple that you can put on a t-shirt your members could wear that would make them identify with your movement. Think “I’m a __________” or “I __________.”
    - I’m a Funnel Hacker.
    - I’m a Lady Boss.
    - I build funnels.
    - I see things differently.
    - I’m a biohacker.
 - 4. Create your own Title of Liberty. - Your culture needs a Title of Liberty. Something they can look at when they’re feeling doubtful—a rallying call. Something that will help them know who YOU are, remind them who THEY are, and refocus them on where you are going together.

### The New Opporunity

- The last piece of the puzzle you need to create your movement is something I
call the New Opportunity, or the vehicle for change that you are offering to people. This is by far the most important, yet least understood, part of the process. The difference between having some modest success and changing the world comes down to understanding and implementing the new opportunity.

  Our goal is not to fix what’s not working. Our goal is to REPLACE what’s not working with something better.
  
  WHY PEOPLE DON’T WANT IMPROVEMENT OFFERS
  
  Improvement offers are much harder to sell for a lot of reasons.
  - 1. Improvement is Hard Most people have tried to improve in the past, and for some reason it didn’t work. They’ve tried to lose weight. They’ve tried to make money. They’ve tried to make their relationships better. But if they’re coming to you, then whatever they tried in the past didn’t work for some reason. With a new opportunity, they don’t know what the process will be, so they don’t have to go through the known pain to get the result.
  - 2. Desire vs. Ambition All people have desire, but very few have ambition. My guess is that less than 2% of the population is actually ambitious. Improvement offers are selling to over- achieving ambitious people. If you do sell an improvement offer, you are automatically excluding 98% of the world. You will be fighting an uphill battle.
  - 3. Memories of Poor Past Decisions If your followers are in need of improvement, they must first admit failure. In order for them to say yes to your offer, they have to admit that the choices they made in the past were wrong.
  - 4. Commodity Pricing When you are selling improvement, you are selling against dozens or hundreds of other improvement offers out there. You are stuck in the middle of a very red ocean, competing with everyone else selling similar options. This competition turns what you do into a commodity and pushes the pricing down. It quickly becomes a race to the bottom in terms of pricing.
  
  Dan Kennedy once told me, “If you can’t be the #1 lowest price leader in your market, there is no strategic advantage in being the #2 lowest price leader.” In other words, if you can’t be the cheapest, then you need to become the most expensive. And you can’t do that when you are fighting inside of this red ocean. When you present a new opportunity, you are creating a blue ocean, and all price resistance goes out the window. The #1 reason people don’t want improvement, and the reason they will or won’t join your culture is STATUS.
 
- STATUS: THE ONLY THING THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO MOVE (OR NOT MOVE)

  That’s it. STATUS is the magic word in this business. When someone is presented with an opportunity, their subconscious mind is working on the answer to this question: Is this thing I’m considering going to increase my status or decrease it?
  
  Status as I’m defining it here has nothing to do with how other people perceive you, but rather with how you perceive yourself.
Almost every choice in your life has revolved around status—whether you know it or not.

  If your brain thinks that taking an action will reverse your status, then you won’t do it—UNLESS it finds hope that by temporarily decreasing your status, you could increase it in the future.
  
  People are going to weigh the likelihood of success and elevated status against the risk of failure and the cost of that failure. Your job as the expert is to load up the elevated status side of the scale and decrease the risk of failure. You can do that by creating an amazing product and minimizing risk with things like money-back guarantees, risk reversals, and done-for-you options. The key to making a sale is 100% tied to this concept of status.
  
  And so you can probably see why that is the BIGGEST reason why we don’t sell improvement offers. For someone to say yes to that, they have to admit to poor past decisions and create a huge decrease in status. Then you are forced to fight an uphill battle that few people ever win. So which factors elevate status? Well, it’s different for everyone, but here are a few that are pretty universal.
  - Appearance of intelligence (anything that makes them look smarter)
  - Appearance of wealth, power, or happiness
  - Physical appearance (weight loss, makeup, supplements, etc.)
  - Style (think Mac vs. PC)
  
  Now you might be thinking, “I’m not affected by status considerations. I like to drive a reasonable car and live in a modest home.” If so, I’d like to pose a question. Why? Why do you like driving a car you feel is reasonably priced? Does it have anything to do with the fact that if you drove a Ferrari home one day, you’re afraid that your friends, family, or neighbors would judge you? If they did judge you, how would that affect your status?
  
  Status works on both ends of the spectrum. It’s what makes some people fight for earthly possessions, and it’s also what keeps others from desiring them at all. As much as we may hate to admit it, we are all slaves to what we believe other people will think about us.
