    - after this list add up the followers, subscribers, followers and get an idiotic but generic pool metric
  - Have platform specific dream 100 list. this is the foundation of everything for each platform. Not just looking at people we add companies, keywords that are in your submarket. Submarket example: wealth > marketing > sales funnels
  - Hook - Story - Offer and Attractive character:
    - this is the foundation of how we sell anything online, if a funnel is not converting it is because of the above 3 stones!
    - hook: grabs their attention, email subject line, post, picture, thumbnail, headline in a blog
    - story: two core goals for your story, increase the vlaue of the skill (ephiphany bridges), and build connection to the attractive character (brand)
    - offer: offer can be small as like this post, comment, subscribe, join my list to buy my product
  - Work your way in, buy your way in
    - Dig your well before thirsty. Dont wait for a product to build. Subsribe to everytinh they are publishing. Ask them questions about their life, for this create a new email where you keep all of your dream 100 content. keep your personal youtube seperate.
    - Funnel hack your dream 100: provide value to your fream 100 by posting content of them or redirecting followers to their page or you can send gift or creating content they can use. This is foundation for great traffic Go through phase 1-2-3 with each dream list 100
    - Start with (earned, organic traffic (dream 100list)) get in front of their audience and fill your funnels.
    - Buy your way in (90 percent of your dream 100 will never promote you so you buy ads in their videos before their videos ..etc. basically you buy their audience)
    - Paid ads are how you scale a company fast. Have a breakeven funnel where for each dollar you put into ads you get a dollar back. if you can do this then you dont have an advertising budget you can spend as much as you would like.
  - Traffic that you own:
    - the email list is the key. Thats the big secret. Its the only real asset in any company.
    - It is the best type of traffic, that you own. Whent hey are on your list you can email them as much as you would like.
    - On average (low end) you can average 1 dollar per member. So if you have a 1000 emails you need to be making 1000$ MRR if not go back to offer-story-hook.
  - Follow up Funnels
    - 80 percent of business happen after 5fth follow up, stack one funnel onto another. Have a follow up funnel. Attention spans are so low now you need tools here use these:
      - Retargeting ads
      - Facebook messanger
      - Text messages
    - In your follow up or anything that you are selling use this framek:
      - Emotion
      - Logic
      - Fear (urgency and scarcity)
      - Whatever you are selling weather retargeting ads, email sequence, youtube webinar (for example: 2 email emiton, 2 email lgoci, 1 email fear)
  - Infiltrating the Dream 100
    - your primary distrubtion channel: email
    - your primary show channel: text, video or audio (focus on one channel) (channels: facebook, insta, youtube ..etc)

    - document the journey (document - dont create) (dont create a fantasy influencer persona, be youself that is why just create, talk about your own process rather than the information you want to give them)
    - document what you are obsessed with. You get paid to think for other people.
    - INitial episodes are important, tell your origin story when people who find you later on most of them (pareto) go back to episode one.

  - The main framework for filling your funnel is evergreen, it works on all platforms with tweaks.
  - Framework:
    - 1 - Understand the history and goal of the platform, create win win content for the history, never hack the algorithms like a spammer
    - 2 - Find and model your dream 100 (who is your dream customer, where are they conggeregating, who is already at the top, spend 10 mins everyday like comment. keep track of the content pulse if everybody does the same pattern. Do a pattern interrupt. Algorithms and content always change dont copy but model. If pattern interrupt becoems the pattern it is still effective but less. That is when you should start testing out the next pattern intterrupt. Stay close to your dream 100.
