## DotCom Secrets

- `Ladders and Funnels`
  - The Secret Formula: Consists of 4 simple questions:
    - 1) Who is your dream client, who do I want to work with
    - 2) Where can I find them
    - 3) What bait will I use to attract them
    - 4) What results do you want to give them. (A business is not about product or services it is about what results you want to give your dream customers)
  - The value ladder - have a value ladder and a membership (continuity) program. The value ladder is the key. Usually it is 4 steps, never go below 4 steps, upper there is no limit.
  - From ladder to a funnel: 
    - traffic > bait > frontend > middle > backend > $
    - At every step of the vallue ladder we provide value and every product we sell have its own sales funnel.
  - How to find your dream customers:
    - question #1 -> Who is your target market?
    - question #2 -> Where is your target market conggegarating?
    - question #3 -> how can you get a customer to leave the conggregation and check out your page?

    - Traffic you control
    - Traffic you don't control
    - Traffic you Own

  - Traffic I control: email ads (solo ads, banners, links, mentions), pay-per-click ads (facebook, google .etc.), Banner Ads, Native Ads, Affiliates and joint ventures. (goal is always send the purchased traffic to a squeeze page. One goal of that page convert traffic that you control into that you own.
  - Traffic You Don't Control -> social media, search traffic, guest blog traffic, youtube, guest interviews. (you have no control over this, but again your only goal is to turn this into owned traffic push all of it back to your blog.

    - 20+ blogs that they actively read
    - 20+ youtube channels they subscribed to
    - after this list add up the followers, subscribers, followers and get an idiotic but generic pool metric
  - Have platform specific dream 100 list. this is the foundation of everything for each platform. Not just looking at people we add companies, keywords that are in your submarket. Submarket example: wealth > marketing > sales funnels
  - Hook - Story - Offer and Attractive character:
    - this is the foundation of how we sell anything online, if a funnel is not converting it is because of the above 3 stones!
    - hook: grabs their attention, email subject line, post, picture, thumbnail, headline in a blog
    - story: two core goals for your story, increase the vlaue of the skill (ephiphany bridges), and build connection to the attractive character (brand)
    - offer: offer can be small as like this post, comment, subscribe, join my list to buy my product
  - Work your way in, buy your way in
    - Dig your well before thirsty. Dont wait for a product to build. Subsribe to everytinh they are publishing. Ask them questions about their life, for this create a new email where you keep all of your dream 100 content. keep your personal youtube seperate.
    - Funnel hack your dream 100: provide value to your fream 100 by posting content of them or redirecting followers to their page or you can send gift or creating content they can use. This is foundation for great traffic Go through phase 1-2-3 with each dream list 100
    - Start with (earned, organic traffic (dream 100list)) get in front of their audience and fill your funnels.
    - Buy your way in (90 percent of your dream 100 will never promote you so you buy ads in their videos before their videos ..etc. basically you buy their audience)
    - Paid ads are how you scale a company fast. Have a breakeven funnel where for each dollar you put into ads you get a dollar back. if you can do this then you dont have an advertising budget you can spend as much as you would like.
  - Traffic that you own:
    - the email list is the key. Thats the big secret. Its the only real asset in any company.
    - It is the best type of traffic, that you own. Whent hey are on your list you can email them as much as you would like.
    - On average (low end) you can average 1 dollar per member. So if you have a 1000 emails you need to be making 1000$ MRR if not go back to offer-story-hook.
  - Follow up Funnels
    - 80 percent of business happen after 5fth follow up, stack one funnel onto another. Have a follow up funnel. Attention spans are so low now you need tools here use these:
      - Retargeting ads
      - Facebook messanger
      - Text messages
    - In your follow up or anything that you are selling use this framek:
      - Emotion
      - Logic
      - Fear (urgency and scarcity)
      - Whatever you are selling weather retargeting ads, email sequence, youtube webinar (for example: 2 email emiton, 2 email lgoci, 1 email fear)
  - Infiltrating the Dream 100
    - your primary distrubtion channel: email
    - your primary show channel: text, video or audio (focus on one channel) (channels: facebook, insta, youtube ..etc)
    - for starting build one show on one channel
    - publish daily
    - document the journey (document - dont create) (dont create a fantasy influencer persona, be youself that is why just create, talk about your own process rather than the information you want to give them)
    - document what you are obsessed with. You get paid to think for other people.
    - INitial episodes are important, tell your origin story when people who find you later on most of them (pareto) go back to episode one.
- `Fill your funnel`
  - The main framework for filling your funnel is evergreen, it works on all platforms with tweaks.
  - Framework:
    - 1 - Understand the history and goal of the platform, create win win content for the history, never hack the algorithms like a spammer
    - 2 - Find and model your dream 100 (who is your dream customer, where are they conggeregating, who is already at the top, spend 10 mins everyday like comment. keep track of the content pulse if everybody does the same pattern. Do a pattern interrupt. Algorithms and content always change dont copy but model. If pattern interrupt becoems the pattern it is still effective but less. That is when you should start testing out the next pattern intterrupt. Stay close to your dream 100.

    - 4 - work your way in
    - 5 - buy your way in

  - Fill your funnel organically:
    - Delete all posts where you are trying to forecfully sell them. Start serving and interacting, be entertainig have fun with your followers. Dont spam your followres. Dont be a consumer be a producer on the platform where you will generate traffic.
  - Fill your funnel with Paid Ads (buying your way in)
    - Have a break even funnel that will be profitable to run ads so that you dont have a budget. You will run ads until it is profitable.
    - Have a small test budget with each new funnel, set up few ads. If the funnel flops send back to the drawing board and rework.

        - Story/Content - value from hook
        - Offer - CTA (like, comment, sub)
        - Dont sell in these videos
      - Second type of videos (webinars - they are less keyword focused as they are created to build stronger relationship with current subscribers. You can sell in these. Still use keywords but try to teach or create something that may not fit in.

  - You only need 1000 true fans to make a living.
  - The Attractive Character (Look at what you geek out on. That is your super power. Be just one step ahead of your audience)
  - Select 1 from 3 core markets - health, weatlh, relationships
  - Core - submarket - niche
    - for ex: health -> nutrition -> high-fat-diets
  - Questions to ask about your niche:
    - #1 -> Would people in this submarket be exited about the new opportunity im presenting in my niche?
    - #2 -> Are the people in this market irrationaly passionate? (communities, forums, feedback groups, events, talks)
    - #3 -> Are these people willing and able to spend money on information?
    - #4 -> Who do you need to become as a leader?
      - Rule 1 - live the life your audience wishes they could live
      - Rule 2 - Maintain absolute certainty
      - Rule 3 - Dont be boring. Cause polarity without going into the crazy zone. neutrality is boring.
      - Rule 4 - Understand how to use persuasion (encrourage dreams, justify failures, allay fears, confirm suspicion, throw rock at enemies, us vs them.)
      - Rule 5 - Care ... A LOT! (it is important ot make money but dont be in it just for the money sake)
      - Rule 6 - Offer them value from their percieved relationship with you. Don't try to define the value you are giving. Allow them to define your value. Maybe they just want to be part of a community. Dont force success.
