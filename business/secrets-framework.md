    - this is the foundation of how we sell anything online, if a funnel is not converting it is because of the above 3 stones!
    - hook: grabs their attention, email subject line, post, picture, thumbnail, headline in a blog
    - story: two core goals for your story, increase the vlaue of the skill (ephiphany bridges), and build connection to the attractive character (brand)
    - offer: offer can be small as like this post, comment, subscribe, join my list to buy my product
  - Work your way in, buy your way in
    - Dig your well before thirsty. Dont wait for a product to build. Subsribe to everytinh they are publishing. Ask them questions about their life, for this create a new email where you keep all of your dream 100 content. keep your personal youtube seperate.
    - Funnel hack your dream 100: provide value to your fream 100 by posting content of them or redirecting followers to their page or you can send gift or creating content they can use. This is foundation for great traffic Go through phase 1-2-3 with each dream list 100

    - Buy your way in (90 percent of your dream 100 will never promote you so you buy ads in their videos before their videos ..etc. basically you buy their audience)
    - Paid ads are how you scale a company fast. Have a breakeven funnel where for each dollar you put into ads you get a dollar back. if you can do this then you dont have an advertising budget you can spend as much as you would like.
  - Traffic that you own:
    - the email list is the key. Thats the big secret. Its the only real asset in any company.
    - It is the best type of traffic, that you own. Whent hey are on your list you can email them as much as you would like.
    - On average (low end) you can average 1 dollar per member. So if you have a 1000 emails you need to be making 1000$ MRR if not go back to offer-story-hook.
