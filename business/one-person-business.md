# One-Person-Business Model

- If you don’t position a product or service to a specific person (identity) with a specific goal that implies a specific problem, you won’t make money. The Creator Economy is composed of individuals distributing value in the form of content and products. They educate their audience on the skills and interests that will aid in the actualization of their goals. Their products or services are meant to generate results and move them faster toward those goals.

  
- Stop trying to solve imaginary problems.
    
  Solve your problems.
    
  Change your own life.
    
  Package up the method.
    
  Slap a price tag on it.

- Path 1) Learn A Skill, Sell A Skill
  - Learn a modern skill that creators or brands use in their business (like email marketing, funnel design, or content writing)
  - Create content based on that skill to flex your knowledge (frankly, this won’t gain many followers. Your profile will be more like a resume).
  - Charge higher prices for a freelance or consulting service because you don’t have the audience to sell a product in your sleep.
 
  For any of this to work, you will have to learn the evergreen skills: writing, speaking, marketing, and sales.

- Path 2) Become A Value Creator Around Your Interests (health, wealth, relationships)
  - Genuine interests (what are you obsessed with learning) (skills: research, learning, note-taking)
  - Your unique perspective (how will they help you reach your goals) (skills: critical thinking, open-mindness, self-improvement)
  - Value creation (how will they help others reach their goals) (skills: marketing/sales, writing and thinking, education and teaching)
