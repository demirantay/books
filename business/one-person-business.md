# One-Person-Business Model

- If you don’t position a product or service to a specific person (identity) with a specific goal that implies a specific problem, you won’t make money. The Creator Economy is composed of individuals distributing value in the form of content and products. They educate their audience on the skills and interests that will aid in the actualization of their goals. Their products or services are meant to generate results and move them faster toward those goals.

  
- Stop trying to solve imaginary problems.
    
  Solve your problems.
    
  Change your own life.
    
  Package up the method.
    
  Slap a price tag on it.

- Path 1) Learn A Skill, Sell A Skill
  - Learn a modern skill that creators or brands use in their business (like email marketing, funnel design, or content writing)
  - Create content based on that skill to flex your knowledge (frankly, this won’t gain many followers. Your profile will be more like a resume).
  - Charge higher prices for a freelance or consulting service because you don’t have the audience to sell a product in your sleep.
 
  For any of this to work, you will have to learn the evergreen skills: writing, speaking, marketing, and sales.

- Path 2) Become A Value Creator Around Your Interests (health, wealth, relationships)
  - Genuine interests (what are you obsessed with learning) (skills: research, learning, note-taking)
  - Your unique perspective (how will they help you reach your goals) (skills: critical thinking, open-mindedness, self-improvement)
  - Value creation (how will they help others reach their goals) (skills: marketing/sales, writing and thinking, education and teaching)
  - Value Distribution (where they will find your value on the internet) (skills: social media, digital tools, leverage building)

- Path 3) Do Both For Maximum Effect
  - When you get results for your own brand, you then have the knowledge to help others with theirs.
  - The product or service you will sell (to practice your skill development) will be based on your interests.
  - You will create a minimum viable offer around those interests with a freelance or consulting service. As you grow your audience with the content you produce, you can eventually turn that into a product that sells with less effort.
  - This is a longer path, but oh so worth it.

- ****The 4 Pillars Of A 6-Figure One-Person Business****
    - Goals (what you want out of life) →  Brand (What are you leading people towards)
    - Problems (What is standing in your way) → Content (what roadblocks they will encounter)
    - Systems (how did you solve the problem) → Product (How they can solve their problems faster)
    - Benefits (how has it impacted your life) → Marketing (why should they care about your message)
 
- **Brand** → Your brand is your vision for the future (and your vision evolves as you do). Your vision for the future implies that you have, or are learning, the skills and interests necessary to achieve it.
- **Content** → I like to think of social media as a public note-taking system where you jot down:
    - • What you are learning and how it applies to your life
    - • Your thoughts and opinions on your skills and interests
    - • The lessons you are learning throughout the story of life

    But, you can’t just write things out and pray that you grow your brand. You have to study marketing, and persuasion, and immerse yourself in content that does well so you can note the patterns between them all.
- **Product** → Here’s the progression:
    - • Identify a problem in your life
    - • Turn it into a personal project for experience
    - • Turn it into a minimum viable offer
    - • Start selling for $500-$1000 (freelancing or consulting)
    - • Build your audience along the way with content
    - • Increase the depth and complexity of your offer
    - • Productize it when you feel ready so it can sell in your sleep
    
    Where does a “project” come into play? Projects are how you actually solve your problems in the real world. They force you to apply what you learn. They are also tangible, they are your result. You can iterate on them and get better with time. You can reflect on them and make it easier to achieve for the next person.

- Marketing → You won’t make a single penny if you never promote yourself. Use Traditional Marketing, Russell Brunson dream customers …etc. you have to play the traditional game.

- Distrubiton Network (dan koe)
  - Growth (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Shorts -> short form)
  - Authenticity (Podcast, Youtube, Newsletter)
  - Authority (Course, Cohort, Community)
  
  All above combined -> Brand (interests, experience, expertise)

- Books, digital products, and high-value long-form content have a higher potential impact than servicing a few select people with freelancing or coaching.

- Most one-person business beginners don’t see content for what it is. It’s not about catching attention. It’s not about getting the most followers. It’s not about having the most engagement. It’s about valuable ideas.

- As with all domains of life, there are developmental stages. A stage 1 creator can’t send out an email and make $50K on demand like a stage 3 can.

- `Stage 1 Creators (Low Leverage)`
  - This is where every single new creator starts. Use the formula that works out there. Here’s what to focus on in Stage 1 of your creator journey:
  - 1 - High Performing Content** - Study popular tweets, viral content, and attention-grabbing headlines. Immerse yourself in them, deconstruct why they work, and start testing what you learn in your own content.
  - 2 - Content Templates As Training Wheels - Almost every single social media course has content templates that you can follow. Use these as training wheels. Hook > value > conclusion. (u can use russell brunson)
  - 3 - Short Form Growth & Idea Validation - Tweets, reels, TikToks, shorts, Instagram posts, and LinkedIn posts are all styles of short-form content. If you can master short form, you will have a solid base when it’s time to evolve into stages 2 and 3.

- `Stage 2 Creators (Medium Leverage)`
  - Once you hit 10K followers or so, you should feel like you have the whole social media growth game down. You don’t have to wait until this point to monetize, and I actually recommend not to wait,
  - **1) Learn Direct Response** - Direct response marketing or copywriting has the purpose of persuading people to convert immediately. Sales and offer creation are also lumped into this – worth studying.
  - **2) Build A High Ticket Offer** - When you are between 10,000 to 80,000 followers, you don’t have the time in the game to pull in big money without a high ticket offer. At this stage, you have ample traffic – and hopefully skill – to land 4+ clients at $2500-$5000 per month. Focus on getting results, refining your unique system, and preparing yourself to evolve into stage 3.
  - **3) Branch Into Long Form Content** - You do this by turning your validated ideas into long-form podcasts, newsletters, or YouTube videos. The depth you create behind these ideas is what will turn followers into die-hard fans. And, you will find new ways of approaching the ideas to start creating your mental monopoly.
 
    I would recommend starting with a newsletter. Long-form content doesn’t disappear. You can stack up 20+ newsletters and repurpose them to other platforms later. If you are stuck in this stage, you are in another 9-5, You have just enough clients to make a living, but not enough time to utilize the leverage you’ve built.

- `Stage 3 Creators (High Leverage)`
  - Many don’t reach this stage,  Because it’s impossible without survival mastery, ego development, and multidisciplinary study. People get locked into the “one thing” mindset (which isn’t bad at the beginning), build themselves into a high-ticket client cycle, and don’t pursue complementary interests and skills.
  - 1 - Productize, Build A Network, & Leverage Results - By now, you may have already created a product. If so, good work. But, by now, you definitely should have results from your service. You should iterate.
      - Take your system and method for getting results
      - Reposition it towards a broader audience (beginner level)
      - Use your results as initial social proof to have a 6 figure launch
  - 2 - Refine Your Ideas & Diversify - Growth comes from short-form content. Authority comes from product or service results. Authenticity comes from long-form big idea synthesis.
       - In stage one, 80%+ of your content should be focused on growth.
       - In stage two, you start to incorporate more authority content around the product or service you are selling. You start to dabble in authenticity with long-form (20%).
       - In stage 3, it’s time to double down on your best ideas and use them to grow on other platforms.
  - 3 - Prioritize Long Form Content - Once you reach a point of high income and high followers, it’s time to put a heavy emphasis on being a synthesizer. This is best done with long form. In short, you:
        - Pursue what interests you
        - Study the big-picture ideas of those interests
        - Note patterns based on your experience
        - Connect the dots with long-form content
        - Create your own versions of concepts, processes, and philosophies
        - Take pieces of that long form for your short-form content

- But, don’t worry, I also fell into the trap of wanting to live the life of someone else. That was, until I experienced it.

  People of depth and value are the ones that get paid the most. They aren’t one-dimensional. They train their mind just as much as their body. They are the generalists that hire the specialists — and the specialists, 90% of the time, are going to be the robots that were designed to take on repetitive tasks. Automations, no-code tools, and software that weren’t a thing 10 years ago.
