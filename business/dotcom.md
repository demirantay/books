## Intro

### What the Online Marketing Wizard Fraternity Doesn't Want you to Know

- It is in the wizard’s best interest for you to believe everything in the online media, marketing and business world is shiny and new, constantly changing, and un-tethered from the old rules, principles, facts, and math of successful advertising and marketing It is your responsibility to resist the seduction of short-lived, bright and shiny lures, popularity and peer pressure.
  
  This book offers solid ground in the very ethereal world of online marketing and commerce. It properly treats Internet media as media— not as a business. It utilizes the science of split-testing. It builds on long-proven marketing funnel and sales architecture. It takes a very disciplined approach
  
  In truth, this is a proven playbook for growing your company with effective lead generation and sales/conversion methods, which can be used online and offline

### Introduction

- That little seminar re-ignited my interest in business and direct response marketing. I remember hearing the speakers talk about how people were using the Internet to make money in a way that was almost identical to what I had learned when I was a kid. But instead of using mail, they were using email; instead of using magazines, they had blogs; instead of the radio, they were using podcasts. It was fascinating, and I was hooked from Day One.

  Old Media VS New Media:
  - direct mail -> email
  - networking -> facebook
  - radio -> podcast
  - sitcom+tv -> youtube
  - reality tv -> instagram
  - newspapers -> Blogs
  
  It took almost two full years of studying, researching, and interviewing successful marketers before I realized that what I was seeing online wasn’t the full business. The people who were making money were doing it through steps and processes invisible to the naked eye.
  
  Everything I Show You in this Book Is Evergreen. If you’ve tried to learn how to grow your company online in the past, you’ve probably purchased books and courses with systems that worked when they were created, but became outdated before they even got to the publisher. When Google changes an algorithm or Facebook introduces a new layout, many tactics suddenly become obsolete.
  
  This book, on the other hand, is a playbook for creating marketing funnels that will
exponentially increase your sales online. It is an evergreen guide. It will be as useful ten years from now as it is today. I only focus on strategies and concepts that will remain the same—even when technology changes.

  I Don’t Just Teach This Stuff; I Actually Do It. There are a ton of people teaching Internet marketing, and the vast majority of them make money by teaching other people the Internet marketing strategies they learned about online. Dan Kennedy calls those people “shovel sellers” because during the gold rush, the people who made the most money were the ones selling the shovels. Today’s “shovel sellers” are selling you Internet marketing strategies without actually using any of the strategies themselves.

## Ladders and Funnels

### The Secret Formula

- The secret formula consists of four simple questions. These are the same four questions that I ask anyone who hires me for personal consultations

  Question #1: Who Is Your Dream Client? The first question you have to ask yourself is, Who do I actually want to work with? Most of us start with a product idea, never thinking about who we want as clients, customers, vendors, and associates. But these are the people you will be interacting with day in and day out. You’ll probably spend more time with these people than your own friends and family. You choose your significant other carefully, so why wouldn’t you take the same time and care in deciding who your dream client or customer will be?
  
  Who are my dream clients? What do they look like? What are they passionate about? What are their goals, dreams, and desires?
  
  After about a week of thinking about the WHO question, I sat down and created two customer avatars: one for the men I wanted to work with and one for the women I wanted to work with. For the women, I picked a name and wrote it down: Julie. Then I listed out the things I knew about Julie. She is successful and driven; she has a message to share; she values her personal growth over money; and she’s already grown her business to at least five figures a year. Next, I wrote down the name Mike. Next to Mike’s name, I wrote out the things I knew about Mike. He is a former athlete. At some point, he has helped to change someone’s life in a small way and wants to learn how to help more people. He values growth over money, and he’s already built his business to at least five figures a year.
  
  This may seem like a silly exercise, but it’s important that you do it anyway. Really spend some time thinking about who you want to work with. Write out their characteristics and then go find an actual picture to represent them. It’s amazing how your perspective changes when you have a physical picture of your ideal customer—instead of a hazy, half-formed image in your head.
  
  Question #2: Where Can You Find Them? The next question in the Secret Formula is WHERE can you find this ideal man or woman? Where do they hang out online? Are they on Facebook or Instagram? What groups are they part of? What email newsletters do they subscribe to? What blogs do they read? Are they reading The New York Times or The Huffington Post? What other interests do they have? Do they like sports or the arts? How about fishing or race cars? If you don’t know the who, it will be hard to find out where your perfect client can be found.
  
  Question #3: What Bait Will You Use to Attract Them? Once we know where the dream customers are, we have to create the right bait to attract them. Your bait could be a physical book, a CD, DVD, or an audio recording—anything that your dream customer would pay attention to and want. As my company moved away from selling to beginners and toward attracting dream clients, our first step was to create new bait that would attract “Mike” or “Julie.”
  
  When you find out what your dream clients want, it becomes very easy to attract them
  
  Question #4: What Result Do You Want To Give Them? Once you’ve hooked your dream customers with the perfect bait, the last question is what RESULT do you want to give them? I’m not talking about what product or service you want to sell them. A business is NOT about products and services. A business is about what result you can get for your clients. Once you (and they) understand that concept, then price is no longer a barrier.
  
  Imagine that your clients could pay you anything to get a desired result. What, then, would you do to help guarantee their success? Where would you lead them? What does that place look like? Keep that place in your mind; it’s the pinnacle of success for your clients. It’s where you want to take them, and it’s the key to this last step
  
  That’s it. The four steps again are as follows:
  - 1 - Who are your dream clients?
  - 2 - How can you find them?
  - 3 - What bait will you use to attract them?
  - 4 - What result do you want to give them?

### The Value Ladder 

- When I walked into the dentist office that morning, I had come in for a free teeth cleaning. And in less than an hour, I walked out paying over two thousand dollars for my whitening kit and my new retainers. This dentist had strategically taken me through a powerful process that I call a Value Ladder. First, he had created bait (free teeth cleaning) that would attract his dream client (me). Second, he provided value to me by cleaning my teeth and noticing that my teeth had become yellow. Because I had received value, I naturally wanted to move forward and get additional value from him. He then found another way that he could provide value to me—the retainers—and again, I naturally took him up on that offer as wel
  
  Now, ideally we would like to sell everyone our best thing, right? You want to serve your customers in the highest way possible. But the sad truth is that if I were to walk up to you on the street and say, “Give me a million dollars, and I’ll help you to grow your company,” you would either laugh in my face or run away, thinking I was insane, It’s because we just met, and so far, I haven’t provided you any value.
  
  You may buy one of my home study courses or attend one of my live events. If you receive value from that, then you may decide to sign up for my $10,000 Ignite program, or maybe my $25,000 Inner Circle program. And if I provide awesome value there, then you will naturally want to keep ascending ... and THAT is how we sell our million-dollar packages.
  
  no Value Ladder is complete without a good continuity program. There are many ways to structure your continuity program. It could be organized around software, membership sites, or ongoing coaching, but it should be something you can bill for each month. That residual income will become the lifeblood of your business. For my DotComSecrets business, our main continuity program is our software ClickFunnels, which allows people to create sales funnels with the click of a mouse. Our clients pay us monthly to use this software to help run their businesses. It saves them a ton of time and money and provides us with residual income. Win-Win.
  
  The Value Ladder is the key to building your marketing funnels and mastering everything else I’m going to teach you in this book. This system does not work if all you have is one thing—like a book or an adjustment. You need to be able to build out a full Value Ladder. Most businesses I look at have one or two pieces of the ladder, but they rarely have all four.
  
  I realized that there really is no end to your Value Ladder. It’s one of the reasons why we created our million-dollar
program. Imagine my shock and excitement the first time someone said yes! A percentage of your audience will always want to pay you the premium to get more value. The only limit to your value offerings is your imagination.
  
  Often times, it’s hard for companies to figure out how to add more offers to their Value Ladders. Typically, the process is very easy for someone selling information products because that ascension path has already been created and proven in thousands of different information-based companies. But what if you’re selling something else? What if you offer physical products, ecommerce, B2B services, or professional services where the path isn’t quite as clear? Sometimes it takes a little thought and creativity. If you already have a product or a service that you sell in the middle of your ladder, what type of “bait” could you create to attract your dream customer? Often times, companies have a frontend product but nothing more to sell on the backend. 
  
  They brought people into their funnel, but then the relationship ended. People wanted to give them money, but there was no clear path for them to follow. As soon as they added those things into their business, customers naturally started to ascend the ladder. if you want to succeed and beat out your competition, you need to have this Value Ladder in place. Again, unless you have a complete Value Ladder, it’s impossible to build out an effective sales funnel.
