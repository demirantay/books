## Intro

### What the Online Marketing Wizard Fraternity Doesn't Want you to Know

- It is in the wizard’s best interest for you to believe everything in the online media, marketing and business world is shiny and new, constantly changing, and un-tethered from the old rules, principles, facts, and math of successful advertising and marketing It is your responsibility to resist the seduction of short-lived, bright and shiny lures, popularity and peer pressure.
  
  This book offers solid ground in the very ethereal world of online marketing and commerce. It properly treats Internet media as media— not as a business. It utilizes the science of split-testing. It builds on long-proven marketing funnel and sales architecture. It takes a very disciplined approach
  
  In truth, this is a proven playbook for growing your company with effective lead generation and sales/conversion methods, which can be used online and offline

### Introduction

- That little seminar re-ignited my interest in business and direct response marketing. I remember hearing the speakers talk about how people were using the Internet to make money in a way that was almost identical to what I had learned when I was a kid. But instead of using mail, they were using email; instead of using magazines, they had blogs; instead of the radio, they were using podcasts. It was fascinating, and I was hooked from Day One.

  Old Media VS New Media:
  - direct mail -> email
  - networking -> facebook
  - radio -> podcast
  - sitcom+tv -> youtube
  - reality tv -> instagram
  - newspapers -> Blogs
  
  It took almost two full years of studying, researching, and interviewing successful marketers before I realized that what I was seeing online wasn’t the full business. The people who were making money were doing it through steps and processes invisible to the naked eye.
  
  Everything I Show You in this Book Is Evergreen. If you’ve tried to learn how to grow your company online in the past, you’ve probably purchased books and courses with systems that worked when they were created, but became outdated before they even got to the publisher. When Google changes an algorithm or Facebook introduces a new layout, many tactics suddenly become obsolete.
  
  This book, on the other hand, is a playbook for creating marketing funnels that will
exponentially increase your sales online. It is an evergreen guide. It will be as useful ten years from now as it is today. I only focus on strategies and concepts that will remain the same—even when technology changes.

  I Don’t Just Teach This Stuff; I Actually Do It. There are a ton of people teaching Internet marketing, and the vast majority of them make money by teaching other people the Internet marketing strategies they learned about online. Dan Kennedy calls those people “shovel sellers” because during the gold rush, the people who made the most money were the ones selling the shovels. Today’s “shovel sellers” are selling you Internet marketing strategies without actually using any of the strategies themselves.

## Ladders and Funnels

### The Secret Formula

- The secret formula consists of four simple questions. These are the same four questions that I ask anyone who hires me for personal consultations

  Question #1: Who Is Your Dream Client? The first question you have to ask yourself is, Who do I actually want to work with? Most of us start with a product idea, never thinking about who we want as clients, customers, vendors, and associates. But these are the people you will be interacting with day in and day out. You’ll probably spend more time with these people than your own friends and family. You choose your significant other carefully, so why wouldn’t you take the same time and care in deciding who your dream client or customer will be?
  
  Who are my dream clients? What do they look like? What are they passionate about? What are their goals, dreams, and desires?
  
  After about a week of thinking about the WHO question, I sat down and created two customer avatars: one for the men I wanted to work with and one for the women I wanted to work with. For the women, I picked a name and wrote it down: Julie. Then I listed out the things I knew about Julie. She is successful and driven; she has a message to share; she values her personal growth over money; and she’s already grown her business to at least five figures a year. Next, I wrote down the name Mike. Next to Mike’s name, I wrote out the things I knew about Mike. He is a former athlete. At some point, he has helped to change someone’s life in a small way and wants to learn how to help more people. He values growth over money, and he’s already built his business to at least five figures a year.
  
  This may seem like a silly exercise, but it’s important that you do it anyway. Really spend some time thinking about who you want to work with. Write out their characteristics and then go find an actual picture to represent them. It’s amazing how your perspective changes when you have a physical picture of your ideal customer—instead of a hazy, half-formed image in your head.
  
  Question #2: Where Can You Find Them? The next question in the Secret Formula is WHERE can you find this ideal man or woman? Where do they hang out online? Are they on Facebook or Instagram? What groups are they part of? What email newsletters do they subscribe to? What blogs do they read? Are they reading The New York Times or The Huffington Post? What other interests do they have? Do they like sports or the arts? How about fishing or race cars? If you don’t know the who, it will be hard to find out where your perfect client can be found.
  
  Question #3: What Bait Will You Use to Attract Them? Once we know where the dream customers are, we have to create the right bait to attract them. Your bait could be a physical book, a CD, DVD, or an audio recording—anything that your dream customer would pay attention to and want. As my company moved away from selling to beginners and toward attracting dream clients, our first step was to create new bait that would attract “Mike” or “Julie.”
  
  When you find out what your dream clients want, it becomes very easy to attract them
  
  Question #4: What Result Do You Want To Give Them? Once you’ve hooked your dream customers with the perfect bait, the last question is what RESULT do you want to give them? I’m not talking about what product or service you want to sell them. A business is NOT about products and services. A business is about what result you can get for your clients. Once you (and they) understand that concept, then price is no longer a barrier.
  
  Imagine that your clients could pay you anything to get a desired result. What, then, would you do to help guarantee their success? Where would you lead them? What does that place look like? Keep that place in your mind; it’s the pinnacle of success for your clients. It’s where you want to take them, and it’s the key to this last step
  
  That’s it. The four steps again are as follows:
  - 1 - Who are your dream clients?
  - 2 - How can you find them?
  - 3 - What bait will you use to attract them?
  - 4 - What result do you want to give them?

### The Value Ladder 

- When I walked into the dentist office that morning, I had come in for a free teeth cleaning. And in less than an hour, I walked out paying over two thousand dollars for my whitening kit and my new retainers. This dentist had strategically taken me through a powerful process that I call a Value Ladder. First, he had created bait (free teeth cleaning) that would attract his dream client (me). Second, he provided value to me by cleaning my teeth and noticing that my teeth had become yellow. Because I had received value, I naturally wanted to move forward and get additional value from him. He then found another way that he could provide value to me—the retainers—and again, I naturally took him up on that offer as wel
  
  Now, ideally we would like to sell everyone our best thing, right? You want to serve your customers in the highest way possible. But the sad truth is that if I were to walk up to you on the street and say, “Give me a million dollars, and I’ll help you to grow your company,” you would either laugh in my face or run away, thinking I was insane, It’s because we just met, and so far, I haven’t provided you any value.
  
  You may buy one of my home study courses or attend one of my live events. If you receive value from that, then you may decide to sign up for my $10,000 Ignite program, or maybe my $25,000 Inner Circle program. And if I provide awesome value there, then you will naturally want to keep ascending ... and THAT is how we sell our million-dollar packages.
  
  no Value Ladder is complete without a good continuity program. There are many ways to structure your continuity program. It could be organized around software, membership sites, or ongoing coaching, but it should be something you can bill for each month. That residual income will become the lifeblood of your business. For my DotComSecrets business, our main continuity program is our software ClickFunnels, which allows people to create sales funnels with the click of a mouse. Our clients pay us monthly to use this software to help run their businesses. It saves them a ton of time and money and provides us with residual income. Win-Win.
  
  The Value Ladder is the key to building your marketing funnels and mastering everything else I’m going to teach you in this book. This system does not work if all you have is one thing—like a book or an adjustment. You need to be able to build out a full Value Ladder. Most businesses I look at have one or two pieces of the ladder, but they rarely have all four.
  
  I realized that there really is no end to your Value Ladder. It’s one of the reasons why we created our million-dollar
program. Imagine my shock and excitement the first time someone said yes! A percentage of your audience will always want to pay you the premium to get more value. The only limit to your value offerings is your imagination.
  
  Often times, it’s hard for companies to figure out how to add more offers to their Value Ladders. Typically, the process is very easy for someone selling information products because that ascension path has already been created and proven in thousands of different information-based companies. But what if you’re selling something else? What if you offer physical products, ecommerce, B2B services, or professional services where the path isn’t quite as clear? Sometimes it takes a little thought and creativity. If you already have a product or a service that you sell in the middle of your ladder, what type of “bait” could you create to attract your dream customer? Often times, companies have a frontend product but nothing more to sell on the backend. 
  
  They brought people into their funnel, but then the relationship ended. People wanted to give them money, but there was no clear path for them to follow. As soon as they added those things into their business, customers naturally started to ascend the ladder. if you want to succeed and beat out your competition, you need to have this Value Ladder in place. Again, unless you have a complete Value Ladder, it’s impossible to build out an effective sales funnel.

### From a Ladder to a Funnel

- Now it’s time to bridge the gap between a Value Ladder and a sales funnel.  But first, I need you to understand what a sales funnel is and how that relates to everything we’ve discussed so far.

  It’s almost impossible to build a company just offering your high-end services. You need a full range of offers. So instead of trying to convince someone to buy the most expensive offering right away, we build a funnel that will help us to do two things:
  - 1 - Provide value to each customer at the unique level of service that he or she can afford.
  - 2 - Make money and be profitable while identifying our dream clients who can afford our highest offer.

  Such as: Traffic > Bait > Frontend > Middle > Backend > $
  
  Above the funnel is a cloud that represents all of my potential customers. At the top of my funnel is the “bait” that will attract my dream customers. Notice that this bait is also the first rung of the Value Ladder. As I start to place ads featuring my bait, potential customers will start raising their hands, and a certain percentage of those people will purchase my frontend offer. Every product we sell has its own sales funnel to provide value and convert the buyer into a higher-end customer.

### How To Find Your Dream Customers

- Usually my clients can figure out pretty quickly who they want to sell to, but they get stuck figuring out where those dream clients are and how to get them to visit their websites. The process of getting people to come to your website is called “driving traffic.” So when I talk about “traffic” throughout this book, I’m talking about the people you are convincing (through an ad) to come to your website.

  One of the coolest things about the Internet is the power of congregations. These seemingly unimportant groups of people gathering together in little corners of the Internet make it possible for people like you and me to get into business quickly and be successful without all the barriers and expensive hurdles of traditional media.
  
   Now, if I have a product to sell to a congregation of people who love Magic: The Gathering, it’s easy and economical to go online, find where they are, and get my message in front of them. are three questions you have to ask yourself to find and really tap into these congregations
   
   QUESTION #1: WHO IS YOUR TARGET MARKET? 
   
   In the old days, the best you could do was group people in general terms, according to age, gender, income, and geographical location. The Internet has changed all that. Today you can get as granular as you want to with the data available. You can segment people based on musical taste, medical background, and shoe size. If you like, you can even group according to the movies they watched last month or the websites they visited yesterday. Because marketers are now able to target so many different characteristics so accurately, people have lost all patience for generalized, mass media messages.
   
   There’s just too much information bombarding us at all hours of the day and night. As modern humans, we are subconsciously forced to screen out anything that doesn’t directly apply to us. To create hyper-targeted messages, you have to know your target market inside and out. Successful businesses get inside of the customer’s mind and find out what the individual really cares about. What are their pains and passions? What do they desire? What do they think about, and what do they search for online?  I suggest digging into your own experience to create as detailed a picture as possible for the product you are selling.
   
   QUESTION #2: WHERE IS YOUR TARGET MARKET CONGREGATING?
   
   Remember your target market is made up of real people, so you need to look at their real behavior. Where do they hang out online? Where do they spend their time? What email newsletters might they subscribe to? What blogs do they read? What Facebook groups are they a part of? Are they even on Facebook—or do they prefer Instagram? What keywords are they searching for on Google? What books are they buying on Amazon? Answering these questions can take some time and research, but it’s worth taking as much time as you need to develop a clear picture of where your ideal clients are directing their attention.
   
   QUESTION #3: HOW CAN YOU GET A CUSTOMER TO LEAVE THE CONGREGATION AND CHECK OUT YOUR PAGE?
   
   At this point, you have to figure out what offering is special enough to entice a wrestling fan away from his favorite site. How can you divert attention away from what your prospect is currently doing? I call this process the Enquirer Interrupt.
   
- As the entrepreneur for my companies, one of my primary jobs is to identify where the veins of gold are located. This task is not for the person buying the ads, optimizing the ads, or picking the keywords, etc. That’s like expecting a building contractor to know how to pour the foundation, frame the house, put up the sheet rock, and run the electricity. A contractor does not need to know how to do all of those things to build a house

  our job as the entrepreneur is to understand the strategy behind these DotComSecrets and then hire the Facebook guy to run Facebook ads and the Google guy to run Google ads. To this day, I’ve never once run a Google or a Facebook ad, yet I’ve made millions on both platforms. I understand the strategy, and then I set up systems and hire people who are great at the tactics. In this way, we all do what we are best at.

### The Three Types Of Traffic

- Acrucial DotComSecret you must understand to experience exponential growth is this: There are only three types of traffic
  - 1 - Traffic you control
  - 2 - Traffic you don’t control
  - 3 - Traffic you OWN
  
  Once you understand how each type of traffic works and how they tie together, you will have the ability to direct the right traffic to the right offers, and convert the highest number possible into buyers and repeat clients. Your one and ONLY goal is to OWN all the traffic you can.
  
- TRAFFIC YOU OWN -- Traffic you own is the BEST kind of traffic. It’s your email list or your followers, readers, customers, etc. I call this the traffic that I “own” because I can send out an email, post a message to my followers, or make a blog post, and I will generate instant traffic. I don’t have to buy it from Google or Facebook. I don’t have to do any PR or SEO. This is my own distribution channel; I can send out messages anytime I want, with no new marketing costs

  The first month, I was able to get about two hundred people to join my list, and I made just a little over two hundred dollars that month. When I had increased my list to about one thousand people, I started to average about one thousand dollars per month.
  
  Yes, we average about one dollar per month for each name on our email lists. In some of the markets we’re in, the profit is actually a lot higher than that.
  
- TRAFFIC YOU CONTROL -- The next type of traffic is traffic you control. You control traffic when you have the ability to tell it where to go. For example, if I purchase an ad on Google, I don’t own that traffic (Google does), but I can control it by buying an ad and then sending those who click on that ad anywhere I want. Any kind of paid traffic is traffic you control, including the following:
  - Email ads (solo ads, banners, links, mentions)
  - Pay-per-click ads (Facebook, Google, Yahoo, etc.)
  - Banner ads
  - Native ads
  - Affiliates and joint ventures
  
  So my goal is always to send any traffic that I am going to purchase over to a type of website we call a “squeeze page.” This squeeze page is a very simple page with ONE goal: to convert traffic that you control into traffic that you own
  
- TRAFFIC YOU DON’T CONTROL -- This last type of traffic just shows up, and I don’t have any control over where it came from or where it goes. For example, if someone mentions my book on Facebook, their followers may search my name in Google, and they may land on some random page in my blog. I didn’t have control over any part of that sequence of events. There are lots of types of traffic that I don’t control, including:
  - Social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, etc.)
  - Search traffic (search engine optimization or SEO)
  - Guest blog traffic
  - YouTube
  - Guest interviews
  
  Now, just like traffic that I control, my ONLY goal with traffic that I don’t control is also to turn it into traffic that I own. To do this, I try to push all traffic that I don’t control. back to my blog. If you visit any of my blogs, you’ll notice that the top third of my blog is nothing but a glorified squeeze page. When people go there, the only real thing they can do is give me their email addresses. After they do that, they become traffic that I own, and I can put them into my communication funnels.

## Your Comminucation Funnel

### The Attractive Character

- People who started my DotComSecrets course used to express this same thought all the time. Business owners often get behind the idea that they should be averaging a dollar per month for every person on their list. So, they focus on growing their lists, yet feel stuck and frustrated when they don’t see results.

  In my experience, the missing link is this concept of the Attractive Character (AC). It’s about the persona you’re sharing with your audience and how you communicate with your list. Most people either don’t bother to create this character, or they don’t do it correctly. So, I want to explain the process to you now. It’s one of the most important steps you can take when it comes to making sales. Once you intentionally create your AC, your business will change forever.
  
  An Attractive Character allows you to build a platform anywhere you want, whether on email, Facebook, or YouTube. Think about any business—online or offline. Most successful ones have an Attractive Character front and center.
  
  This is why sequels and franchises work so well, generation after generation. If you loved Harrison Ford as Han Solo in 1977, you probably paid to see all the Star Wars sequels and Raiders of the Lost Ark, too. And guess what? Nearly forty years later, guess who’s showing up again to bring you a little more Han Solo? It’s amazing to think that one mediocre movie created over a generation ago can still pack the theaters and sell tickets by the millions. That’s the power of Attractive Characters. We love them. We want to be like them. We relate to their stories. And we buy what they’re selling!
  
  This is one of the big secrets behind the most successful online businesses in the most competitive markets, like weight-loss, dating, financial investing, supplements, and ecommerce.
  
  The students who implemented what I’m about to teach you here totally transformed their businesses. All of the major success stories from any of our coaching programs got results by building huge brands and platforms around an Attractive Character.
  
  This concept can mean the difference between making one thousand dollars a month and making one hundred thousand a month. There are three components to creating an Attractive Character:
  - Elements
  - Identity
  - Storylines
  
- THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF THE ATTRACTIVE CHARACTER -- 

  1. Backstory. Every good Attractive Character has to have a backstory. It’s essential if you want results. If you turned on the TV and saw Jared sitting there eating a sub, what would your reaction be? You’d probably think something like, Who’s that annoying skinny guy just sitting there eating subs all day? Without knowing his backstory of amazing weight loss, you would be unable to relate to him. He’d just be a dude eating subs. But if you see Jared’s backstory—pictures of him at 425 pounds and 190 pounds— and then see him eating subs, it’s a whole different story.
  
  The key is that the story has to relate to the product you’re selling somehow. If you’re selling a weight-loss product, you want to talk about a weight-loss backstory. If you’re selling investing advice, you want a financial backstory. 
  
  2. Attractive Characters Speak in Parables. Parables are little stories, easy to remember, that illustrate a relevant point. For example, when I taught my Expert Secrets course, I needed a way to show people that they can make money with any of their talents or skills. So I shared the story, or parable, about the first product I created: a DVD about how to make potato guns. Now, there is a lot to that story that I won’t cover here in this book, but it illustrates the fact that you can create and make money selling your experience or expertise in almost anything. A parable is a story about something that happened in your Attractive Character’s life.
  
  3. Attractive Characters Share Their Character Flaws. This next element is one that most people really struggle with sharing, but it’s one of the most important ones to share because it makes you relatable and real. No one wants to hear about the perfect person—because you can’t relate. Yet most of us try to put on a perfect facade for our audiences, thereby alienating the real men and women we are trying to reach. Conversely, as soon as the audience knows you’re not perfect, that you have character flaws, then they will start to empathize with you. They’ll like you more because you are like them: not perfect.
  
  4. Attractive Characters Harness the Power of Polarity. Another challenge people face when communicating with an audience is trying not to offend anyone. So, instead of being a relatable person, speakers become bland and stay neutral on many topics, only sharing safe things everyone will love. Here’s the problem. While that sounds like the logical thing to do— appeasing everyone—the problem is that being neutral is boring. When an Attractive Character tries to win the votes of everyone, they end up reaching no one. Instead, Attractive Characters are typically very polarizing.
  
- IDENTITY OF AN ATTRACTIVE CHARACTER -- Your Attractive Character will typically take on one of the following types of identities. You get to pick which one you want to be,

  The Leader: The identity of the leader is usually assumed by people whose goal is to lead their audiences from one place to another. Most leaders have a similar backstory to that of their audiences and, therefore, know the hurdles and pitfalls the audience members will likely face on the journey to get ultimate results.
  
  The Adventurer or Crusader: The adventurer is usually someone who is very curious, but he doesn’t always have all of the answers. So he sets out on a journey to discover the ultimate truth. He brings back treasures from his journey and shares them with his audience. This identity is very similar to the leader, but instead of leading his audience on a journey to find the result, he is more likely to bring back the answers to give them.
  
  The Reporter or Evangelist: This identity is often one that people use when they have not yet blazed a trail to share with an audience, but have a desire to. So they put on the hat of the reporter or evangelist and go out to discover the truth. Typically, people who use this identity interview dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of people and share those interviews, and all they’ve learned along the way, with their audience.
  
  This is the identity I used when I got started. I didn’t know a lot about marketing online myself, so I started interviewing people. I became a reporter, just like Larry King or Oprah. Because I started interviewing all these cool people and sharing their stories and lessons, I started building an audience of my own. Becoming a reporter is a great way to start a business in a niche you don’t know much about.
  
  The Reluctant Hero: This is my personal identity now, and typically the one that I try to share with my audiences. This is the humble hero who doesn’t really want the spotlight or any fuss made over his discoveries. But he knows the information or the secrets he has are so important that he must overcome his shyness and share them with the world. There’s a moral duty that compels him to share all he knows. Many of you may feel this way naturally. The spotlight is uncomfortable, but you know you need to be there. If that’s you, the reluctant hero is the perfect identity for you. Play the part.

- ATTRACTIVE CHARACTER STORYLINES -- Stories are a great way to communicate with your audience. And there are six basic storylines that businesses use over and over again in emails, sales letters, landing pages, and other communications. We use them because they work
  - Loss and Redemption: “I had everything. I was on top of the world. Life was great. Then ___________ happened. I had to figure my way out of ________________. But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise because I went through __________, and I learned/received ___________. Now I ___________.”
  - Us vs. Them: You want to use us vs. them stories to polarize your audience. Remember the power of polarity? Using these types of stories will draw your raving fans even closer and give them a rallying cry against the outsiders. I often call out the “talkers vs. the do-ers” on my list. I want people to make a choice about who they are, because if they’re with me, then they will be do-ers, continuing to ascend with me.
  - Before and After: “First I was ______________. Now I’m ___________.”
These are stories of transformation, and they work great in any market. For example, in the weight-loss market, you might say, “First I was fat. Then I tried Program X. Now I’m skinny.” Or, try this with the dating market: “First I was lonely and unattractive. Then I got Program Y. Now, I’ve got chicks all over me.”
  - Amazing Discovery: “Oh my gosh, you guys ... wait til you hear about this amazing new thing I just discovered! You’re not going to believe it, but I hit it out of the park on my first try! I wasn’t sure it would work, but it’s amazing. You’ve got to try it!”
  - Secret Telling: “I’ve got a secret ... if you want to find out what it is, you need to do ___________.” This is my favorite type of storyline. My whole company, DotComSecrets, is built around “secret” storylines. The lure of secrets draws the reader into your funnel and up your Value Ladder.
  - Third-Person Testimonial: Sharing other people’s successes with your products and programs provides powerful social proof. Get as many third-person testimonials from your customers, clients, and students as you can. Then sprinkle them liberally throughout your stories. Or use them as stand-alone stories and case studies.
  
  creating your Attractive Character can mean the difference between making one thousand dollars a month and one hundred thousand.
  
### The Soap Opera Sequence

- When somebody joins your list for the first time, it’s essential that you quickly build a bond between them and the Attractive Character. The way you introduce your character can mean the difference between a subscriber opening your emails consistently or hitting the delete key. 
  
  If your first email is boring, you’re done. They probably won’t open the next one. But if you give them something interesting and hook them with an open storyline in the first email, then they will look forward to the next one, and the next, and the next.
  
  I’m sure you’ve seen directors do this on soap operas or reality shows. The tactic pulls you from commercial break to commercial break, from episode to episode. You see it every day on TV; now it’s your turn to become a master at it with email. Let me walk you through the five-email Soap Opera Sequence that readers get when they join my lists. I’m going to be selling them in this series is called “Expert Secrets.”

  - Email #1: Set the Stage. This is the first email, a thank you note, that people receive the minute they sign up for your list. It sets the stage for the emails to come and lets people know what to expect. Are you going to email them once a day, twice a day, or once a week? For this first sequence, I recommend once a day for the best results.
  - Email #2: Open with High Drama. Okay, if you did a good job opening a loop in email number one, then the reader will be anxiously waiting for your next email to come in. For me, this is where the story “selling” process begins. I learned from Daegan Smith that you ALWAYS start any good story at the point of high drama Backstory. Once you have their attention with emotional drama, you’re going to go back and tell them the backstory. Tell them the events that led up to the high-drama moment. How in the world did you get yourself into such a predicament? Typically, your backstory is going to take you back to a similar spot the readers may be in now.
  
  This backstory will lead up to a spot where you got stuck and hit a wall. Usually this is where the readers are in their lives right now. They are stuck, and that is why they are open to your answers. You explain to them how you hit that wall and then found the answer. But don’t give them the answer yet. Just open the loop, and promise to close it in email number three.
- Email #3: Epiphany. Now it’s time to start bringing in the dawn. You have an epiphany. You realize something you hadn’t thought of before. Maybe it’s something that was right in front of you the whole time. It’s the moment that everything turned around for you. By now the reader is so hooked in, they want to know (and hopefully buy) your solution. Most of the time, your epiphany email will lead back to your core offer— whatever you’re selling that solves the problem.
- Email #4: Hidden Benefits. In this email, you want to point out benefits the reader is getting by knowing you and following your plan or by using your product. You want to focus on benefits that probably aren’t as obvious.
- Email #5: Urgency and CTA. This is usually the last email in my Soap Opera Sequence. It’s NOT the last email I send people, it’s just the end of my introduction. The goal is to give the reader one last push to go take action right now. You do that by adding urgency into the equation and then using a call to action (CTA). Up to now, you’ve been casually using CTAs, but in this last email, you want to light a little fire under readers.

  Whatever the reason, it needs to be real. Fake urgency will backfire on you, and you’ll lose all credibility. Just think of a reason why you might “run out” of whatever you’re selling. If it’s an evergreen product, then create a special sale that ends soon. Or give readers a coupon that expires in twenty-four hours. Be creative! There’s always some way to create real urgency.


### Daily Seinfeld Sequence

- When I first started growing my list, I really struggled to send emails. What did I have to say that was important enough that people would want to open and read it? So I started focusing on writing great, content-packed emails that often took days to write. I thought that was the answer. But I later discovered that after someone had gone through my Soap Opera Sequence and bonded with the Attractive Character, content wasn’t what they responded to.

  My emails switched from 100% content to 90% entertainment and just 10% content, and my readership, opens, clicks, and sales all skyrocketed with the change. You want your Attractive Character to be fun and entertaining.
  
  I know a LOT of people get VERY nervous about how often they email their lists. I used to feel that way, too. I used to email once a month, and my response rates were horrible. So then I started emailing twice a month. And guess what? I more than doubled my income.
  
  Then I decided to email once a week, then twice, then every other day, and what I’ve found now is that if I don’t email my list every day, I lose money every day. The secret to keeping your subscribers happy to hear from you every day is using the Seinfeld format. Be entertaining. Just talk about your day.
  - What’s going on in your Attractive Character’s life?
  - What happened that’s embarrassing?
  - How are you getting through the holiday season?
  - Where are you planning your vacation this year?
  - What did you buy recently that you regret?
  - What did you buy recently that you just adore?
  - What made you scream with rage yesterday, that you’re laughing about today?
  - What crazy antics did your kid or your dog get into yesterday?
  - What funny thing happened in your past that teaches a lesson?
  
  These are emails about nothing. Just random episodes and entertaining stories. EXCEPT ... they have a purpose. The goal is to lead people back to whatever you’re selling. It might be your core offer or some other product or service. It might even be someone else’s product. That’s the secret. That’s how you make money.
  
  If you just send out entertaining emails and don’t tie in your products or services, you won’t make a dime. Not even if you’re the best storyteller in the world. EVERY EMAIL and each story must be tied back into some type of offer for your audience.
  
  Lastly, these emails do double duty when you put them on your blog. People often ask me what they should write about on their blogs, and I always tell them simply to copy and paste their daily Seinfeld email. It’s quick, easy, and consistent blog content that leads people to a sale.
