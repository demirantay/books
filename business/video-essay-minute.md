> What is the total amount of words for a 1, 2 or 3 minute video?

1 minute video should be approximately 150-170 words (with maximum of 6 scenes). Here are some quick numbers: 60 seconds video = 150-170 words (approx) 90 seconds video = 255 words (approx) 2 minute video = 300-340 words (approx) 3 minute video = 450 to 510 words (approx). But let’s say you have a video script already and it’s 744 words. The best way to calculate the length of your video, just divide your script’s word count by 160 (average word count per minute). So in this case 744 / 160 = 4.65 (That means your video is going to be around 4:30-4:40 minute long). Another good (and free) way to calculate this is by using tools like Script Timer – Words to Time Calculator.
