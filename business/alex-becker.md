### 10 year business plan 

(all below are yearly ARR)

- `0 - 100k` -> gain skill + sell time = freelancing (sell high income skills) - code product of other people - paid advertising - ai ... etc.
- `100k - 1m` -> invest 20% of 100k - sell other peoples time like sam owen's consulting.com (become a agency)
- `1m - 5m` -> dont sell time anywhere - no more training wheels, highly scalabel business with not selling peoples time. (informarketing-products / ecommerce shop / small scale software (chrome extensions, shopify plugins .etc)
- `5m - 20m++` -> stop trying to make money, it is not about money it is about ownership.
