# Atmoic Habits Notes

Chapter 1
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long run.
- Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.
- Small changes ofthen appear to make no difference until you cross a critical treshhold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.
- If you want better results, then foget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Chapter 2
- There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change
- The most efective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve but on who you wish to become
- Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continiously edit your beliefes, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (altoguh they can do that) but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

Chapter 3
- Rewards are the endgoal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the rewards. The raving is about wanting the rewards. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.
- If a behaviour is insufficent in any of the four stages it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you wont experiencec enough motivation to act. Make the behaviour difficult and you wont be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you will have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behaviour will not occur. Without all four, a behaviourw will not be repeated.
- Whenever you want to change your behaviour you can simply ask yourself:
  - 1 - how can i make it obvious?
  - 2 - how can i make it attractive?
  - 3 - how can i make it easy?
  - 4 - how can i make it satisfying?
- A habit is a behaviour that has been repeated enough ties to become automatic.
- The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.
- Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, rewards.

Chapter 4
- Over time the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are essentially invisible: the treats on the kichen counter, the remote control ext to the couch, the phone in our pocket.
- Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones.
- If you are still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question I like to use: Does this behaviour help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identitty? Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.
- Once our habits become atomatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
- The process of behaviour change always starts with awareness. you need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.

Chapter 5
- The 1st law of behaviour change is make it obvious
- The two most common cues are time and location
- Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.
- The implementation intention formula is: I will BEHAVIOUR at TIME in LOCATION
- The habit stacking formula is: After CURRENT HABIT I will NEW HABBIT

Chapter 6
- play multiple roles fair enough if your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home.
- Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behaviour over time.
- Every habit is intiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
- It is easier to bild new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.

Chapter 7
- Bad habits are autocatalytic: the proccess feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you dont have the energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you are feeling more anxious. It is a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.
- Researchers refer to this phenomenon as cue-induced wanting: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit.
- A more realiable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
  - If you cant seem to get any work done, leave your phone in a other room for a few hours.
  - If you are continually feeling like you are not enough, stop following social media accounts that trigger jelousy and envy.
  - If you are wasting too much time watching television, move TV out of the bedroom
  - If you are playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it in a closet after each use.
 - Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.
 - People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It is easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
 - One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
 - Self-control is a short term strategy not a long term one.

Chapter 8
- 2nd law of behaviour change: make it attractive the more attractive an opportunity is the more likely it is to be come habit-forming.
- Thoughout our discussion of the 2nd law, our hoal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform every habit a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing.
- Habits are dopamine driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.
- It is the anticipation of a reward - not the fullfillment of it - that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation the greater the dopamine spike.
- Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.

Chapter 9
- The culture we live in determines which ehaviours are attractive to us
- We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.
- We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close(family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful(those with status and prestige)
- The normal behaviour of the tribe often overpowers the desired behaviour of the individual. Most days wed rather be wrong with crowd than be right by ourselves.
- If a behaviour can get us approval, respect and praise we find it attractive.

Chapter 10
- Whenever a habit sccesfully addresses a motive you develop a craving to do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or that watching youtube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and we can use this insight to our adntage rather tan to our detirment.
- You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family. Now imageine changing just one word: You dont have to, you "get" to. You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You et to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviours as burdens and turn them into opportunities. The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mindset we choose.
- The inversion of the 2nd law of behaviour change is make it untrractive.
- Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.
- Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive. 
- Habits are attracive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motiviation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.
