# Agency Business Model

> Most of it is gotten from Jordan Platten

> Business is about Driver and Vehicle (this note is leveling up the vehicle)

- In Agency Business Model all you do is get a skill and sell it as a service to other person/business. That is all there is to it.
- It has been around for centuries (first one in 1800s) and will be around for a long time, just the skills will change.
- It is the easiest business model to start with, that is why it is highly recommended to beginners.
- It gets hard around (100k-300k) around a month. You may need to switch the business model.

## Agency Modules

- 1 - Pick a Service
- 2 - Build a Lead List
- 3 - Outreach to Them
- 4 - Sign Them Up
- 5 - Deliver a Service

(that is all there is to it)

## 1) Pick a Service

You can select whatever service from plumbing to electricity but down below are some good online ones currently (2024)

- Direct ROI Services - (Paid Ads, Email Marketing, Organic Socials)
- Web Dev - (websites, apps, SEO, CRO)
- Operations - (AI / Automation, Recruitment)
- Content - (videography, photography, UGC)
- Sales - (appointment setting, closing)

## 2) Build a Lead List

- This is usually the most time consuming task (this is the first thing you automate -> that is why you automate and buy software, invest in first when you are getting off the ground and get money)
- For lead gen it is always best to be niched down, however when you start out you can just go in for all of them. To see which one you like.
- International client finding is 5x-10x harder than local ones, even if you are in the worst economy try to find clients locally at the start to build out a test case.
  (reaching out to local at the start gives you leverage, get your feet off the ground)

- `Algortihm for generating the leads`
  - Select a niche
  - Avenues for finding businesses
    - Google Maps
    - Google Search
    - Facebook
    - Directories (gov sites etc.)
    - Software
  - Find Decision Maker
  - Use website, directory, software (to find decision maker)

- It is very time consuming to switch between tasks such as generating and outreaching. So at least generate `500` leads. No software, it takes you like a week or two. With software/automation just days. 

## 3) Outreach to Them

Your only goal on outreach is to book a meeting. Not selling, even on door to door.

Multiplatform Strategy for Outreach (best->cold calls)
- 1 - Door to Door
- 2 - Cold Calls
- 3 - Email
- 4 - Direct Message
- 5 - Networking

Once the method is selected, you need a script
like a template, don't start from scratch

Script
- Personal message/chit chat
- Offer/Gurantee (fundemental part of your script)
- Ask for a call (don't sell)
- Book a call (goal)

## 4) Sign Them Up / Sales

- Agency business is not pressure sales / it is helping sales
- Act like a business advisor (someone who is simply there to help them)

Script/Outline for selling-signing up
- 1 - Discovery (most important part)
  - Build Rapport
  - Ask Questions (important)
  - Current vs Desired
- 2 - Present (you can do this on zoom/google/screen)
  - Comparison (competitor)
  - Desire
  - Solution
- 3 - Close
  - Get permission
  - Present price (don't say anything after price!!!)
- If YES -> Bookonboarding
- If NO  -> Objection Handling (you will get 80% this)

## 5) Deliver a Service

- Depens on your service
- Up the value here
