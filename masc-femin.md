In the SIMPLEST of terms masculinity is drive and femininity is nurturing. 

A man with drive will accomplish anything, but if he cannot nurture it it will fall to pieces in moments

A woman who can nurture will keep anything alive, but without drive it shall never grow

And vice versa

Bad drive leads to things toppling from the outside: wars, unresolved fights, families and businesses warring within and without, all "obstacles", the 'others' ,  ideals and people included, being recklessly and aggressively destroyed 

Overbearing nurturing requires that no harmful, painful, or difficult thing be allowed, and will kill a system from within. Restrictions of speech and expression, demonization of the "other", and non physical attacks that hurt finances, reputation, facts ad credibility are it's weapons

Both require balance and wisdom

> The gender does not matter weather or not you are masculine or feminine however, it plays a big part because of society.
