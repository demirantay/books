# Narc Family Structure

- They need a scapegoat or black sheep for several reasons.
- They need a common enemy to gang up on, or they would all be at each other's throats.
- They can't face their insecurities and faults, so they need someone to project them on. They project them and then mistreat the person they project on as a way of shifting blame and distancing themselves from their own issues.
- They can only feel good about themselves if they can be superior to someone else. It is like it doesn't count unless they are better than others. They will talk trash about a lot of people, but the scapegoat is the handy, convenient target that can't escape them, or so they think. That way, there is always someone to mistreat and put down so that they can feel superior whenever and wherever they like. They will even make up fictional sins that their scapegoat is supposed to have committed, because otherwise they might not be able to feel superior enough.
- A scapegoat is familiar, and is not in a position of power or influence, so they will have no incentive to treat the scapegoat decently. They save politeness and faux kindness for people who have something they want, or for the Golden Child, who is their avatar and the person they project all their wishes for themselves on.

Narcs are incapable of acknowledging anything negative about themselves. It shatters their entire psychology. So the role of the scapegoat is to take all of those negative emotions that they feel about themselves and assign them to the scapegoat.

When a scapegoat tries to leave the dynamic, they freak out because psychologically they NEED that scapegoat. Without them, they have nobody to assign their negative emotions too, which endangers the stability of their psyche.
