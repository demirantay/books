- `Face and neck`: Fat tends to be lost in the face and neck early on, leading to a more defined jawline and slimmer facial features.
- `Arms and shoulders`: The arms (particularly the upper arms) and shoulders start to show more definition as fat is reduced. This is often visible relatively early in the process.
- `Legs: The thighs`, calves, and glutes lose fat next. Legs, especially in men, tend to retain less fat than the abdomen, so they may lean out earlier.
- `Chest`: Fat stored in the chest area begins to diminish, revealing more muscle definition in the pectorals.
- `Upper abdomen`: The upper part of the abdomen starts losing fat, especially around the ribs and upper stomach area.
- `Lower abdomen`: The lower belly, also known as the "stubborn fat" area, is often the last place where men lose fat. This is typically the most challenging region to target, requiring consistent effort to reduce.
- `Lower back and flanks`: The love handles and lower back area are also areas where fat tends to persist longer and are typically among the last to lose fat.
