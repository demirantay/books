### Outlier Male

- The great male filter (25-30) starts at 25 if you are not putting in the work. Tih is where genetically or gifted people start to fall off, life and age catches up. No body is prepared for it. after school they are in the desert. There are no parents, teachers. No body keeps you accountable, no body cares.
- Your gains will aggregate in marginal ways and accumulate in a exponential growth who the fuck (men) is having a skin care routine, fuck being a loser.
  
  Aging works the same with women and men but men have the ability to bump other areas which makes the age irrevelant.
