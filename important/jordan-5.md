Jordan Peterson gives a profound bit of life structuring advice in that he says you need:

-Solid career

-Fulfilling friends

-Passionate hobbies

-Romantic interest

-Family ties that are important to you, whether that be kids of your own or relatives that you hold responsibility toward and are close to.

A poor minimum is 2 to function well, and 3 of those to thrive psychologically. So if you eliminate romantic interest, you have 4 other options to get 3/4 or at least 2/4.
