> Funnel = Jefferey > Struggler > Bloomer > Discipline > Enjoyer

5 pillars of self-improvement:
- Finance (short, long, emergency)
- Relationships (yourself, family, community)
- Career/Mission
- Education (formal, informal)
- Health (physical, nutrition, mental, spiritual)


---

- Delayed gratification over instant
- Instant gratification steals from your future
- Dopamine detox!
- Meditation, gratitude, journaling, exercise, and sleep are key things.
- Discipline over motivation
- I don't want to work all day, people who work 60 hours always regret not living their life, work 7-8 hours every day but do it meaningfully. Don't work 12-hour days every day. What is the point?
- Daydreaming is a disease, it is the instant gratification of the mind.
- Pride and Ego are enemies. It just makes you complacent and dumb+numb.
- Quit youtube too it is also a social media.
- Motivating others will motivate you more.
- You do the bad habits because you do not love yourself. You do this by deep journaling and thinking by yourself.
- Fake it till you make it is the worst advice. It is treating the symptoms, not core issues. It is inauthentic. Real confidence comes through work.
- Why do you talk about your goals? Don’t get gratification from it. Always let it show. Never speak about it and try to get validation from it.
- If you have the ego to say you are better than other men and race for resources. You are profiting from that. But always remember ego is the enemy. Without ego and race, you become complacent. You just need to race with top men. Not low competitors.
- Don't set your metric for success (masculinity) and goals on fucking a lot of women. Measure your success in personal development.
- Have a framework for pulling yourself out of your depression. Progressive overload for (self-mission-social) makes it small like (teeth brushing - 10 pages reading - walking)
- Social life is progressive and productive and it is self-improvement. Have goals for it as well.
- Delayed gratification activities with friends like an outdoor workout, hike, or trip, be the initiator just like a date, pick an activity - invite 8-10 people. Do the instant gratification activity too but never overdo and be wary of people you meet there. Have your niche.
- Only meet instant gratification buddies once a week. Delayed gratification friends see as much as you would like.
- Journaling is better than anything. Your ideas will give you and your tribe success.
- Going on a simple walk gives you more happiness than 30.000$ raise. Always put walks in progressive overload. Have adventures while walking. I have always liked this since I was a teenager.
- Don't have cheat days for your diet what is the fucking point. These are just habits.
- Don't try to fit in with friends like degenerates because you form connections with real authenticity. Kova, seker, uyusturucu amk hepsinin. Improve yourself until you fit into the environment you wanna fit in.
- Simple habits for productivity → grayscale on the phone and time tracker on the home page. Habit tracker for self-mission-social like a streak system.
- Hustle culture only focuses on work. Everything else crumbles. It is stupid. Have social days.
- Have a military-style routine do not break it. Best for building habits.
- Have positive self-visualizations like you being happy in Italy, or Portugal. Improve your self-image.
- Selfish men always succeed (either zeki or haydut)
- The journey is the fun part.
- If you want to get your friends on self-improvement show them the pillars and let them choose. Don't shove the menu down their throat. Grow your tribe.
- Intermittent fasting, eating once a day, or having 2-3 windows
- Visualization is a great way to re-program your subconscious mind.
- Fundamentals → Exercise, sleep, diet, meditation
- Improve your nasal breathing by practicing. For best exercise from the nose breathe heavily to extend slowly. You can only sleep goodly if your nose breathes. NEVER BREATHE FROM MOUTH. it is very bad for your health.
- Always protect yourself from bullies, either from women or men. Don’t be a dickhead. Don't be a pussy. Reclaim your aggression. It was beaten out of you when you were a kid. Be healthy with your aggression.
- Increase your testosterone.
- 5 characteristics of Adonis
    - 1 - Discipline
    - 2 - Humility
    - 3 - Presence
    - 4 - Gratitude
    - 5 - Leadership
- Don't hate your family, they are not on self-improvement. They are not enlightened ones. Just don’t let them be the bully they were bred to be that way.
- When you try to fix your problems fast, you make no progress! Even sometimes you get burned out. Make your progress and think about them in months.
- I have two missions - Being the best father and having a purpose that is important to me.
- You are the average of the 5 people whose content you consume.
- Don’t watch Netflix, tv programs, series … etc. it is stupid. It is not art anymore. It is not entertainment anymore. It is just retention.
- Never get complacent, you are not good enough yet.
- Self-improvement is a lifelong program. For example, think of dating, don't look at other people, and think that you need to be fast. Set your goals long term.
- Don't do too much when you start off and get burned off - progressive overload and compound effect. Do not let ego blind you, always remember your agraphobia days.
- Put your notifications off while working, don't let your focus wander off to a woman, family, or friends. This is so important.
- Why do we give a shit about celebrities? Fuck them Don't be a Jessica or Jefferey. Andrew Tate is the same too. Why are you a loser, that cares about celebrities?
- Help your Jefferey friends that have the potential. You don't have to drop them off fully but if they show that they wanna be on self-improvement show them leadership.
- Most friendships are fake it is only bonded over a substance. Be introspective about your friends..
- Make competition within your group is out of love. Competing outside people they are enemies. Destroy your enemies but with your friends compete with love and compete with your younger self.
- Improve your relationships with your parents. You do not have to have a relationship at all but forgive them and break the cycle.
- Be a positive gossiper with your friends. Don't be the guy who gossips negatively.
- Overcome your ego by leveling up your humility skill.
- Dont watch the news, they profit from fear mongering.
- Partying-nightclubs - whats the point? Staying up until 4am is not worth it anymore. Just once is okay. Never indulge too much in instant gratification.
- Social media is making you lonely never forget about that. Why do you want to see people who dont want to be in your life? It just makes you lonely.
- Emotional men are weak, it is important to feel your emotions but your decision should be analytical and disciplined while being motivated by your emotions.
- When you are ata a level you love competition because it is what pushes you even more.
- Quit social media → They are using “interminent reinforcment” it is the most addictive pscyological way to get a mammal to get addicted.
- Instagram, they literally fucked the brain of your future wife because of the validation she gets from other people. Use whatsapp to fucking message. If they dont have your phone number that conversation is not important.

## Relationships

---

- Do not be afraid of rejecting girls, friends, or girlfriends and breaking up with them. Do not prolong the inevitable if your values are not aligning.
- Neediness and needing love is normal, just don't be desperate. The Hollywood idealized lone wolf, avoidant personality makes no sense. Tribes were how we grew.
- Don't do things to impress girls. Do things to impress yourself.
- You become strong by doing strong acts and your self-actualization. How much space you take and eye contact is the main frame.
- Don't chase women, chase goals, women chase you instead. When you chase women, they run away.
- Polarize a woman, instantly display your interest and know if she is interested or not. Show your interest in the first seconds. At first impression, she will categorize you as would fuck - wouldn’t fuck. Give little validation. Usually, a compliment. Like your dress is nice. One single compliment.
- Texting → Be fucking mature - text in a business manner but have an emotional connection. Don’t send poems like Jefferey or just logistics like a red pill degenerate.
    - Step: 1 → Pay compliments the first time, polarize.
    - Step: 2 → Be authentic and match with people like you. Don’t act.
    - Step: 3 → Do not let her lead the convo. You lead.
    - Step: 4 → Structure the date yourself. Invite “I’m going to do X, would you like to join me”
    - Step: 5 → If you feel lit send cute texts like “excited to see you :)” start connecting emotionally this filters trashy toxic women.
    - Step: 6 → Keep going like this don’t break this too much it is a skill even when you are boyfriend and girlfriend.
- Delete dating apps → They are just for casual sex and it is like nightclubs. Instead, meet people in social circles or speak to them in person.
- Mass DM’ing a girl's Instagram is stupid you just get the bottom of the barrel and you get a name for yourself. I will not date a woman who uses Instagram as a dating app also, it just means she will always have a dating app on her phone.
- To meet more women just go outside more. It is that simple you do not need red pill degenerate ideas like going to the dog park.
- If she is not going to be the mother of your children do not proimse her marrige, kids or meeting parents. Have a wholeshome short term love like in high school. Be honest about your intentions. 
- Keep in mind the self-improvement relationship trap → Have a standard, don't let the ones that are coming in like Jessicas, masculine women, dating apps … etc. Remember if she is on self-improvement as well your progress improves not dips. Because they will never be into self-improvement as much as you do. You are gonna have to set some limitations.
- Apart from beauty and sex what she offers you? Is she a loser? It is okay but will she change herself?
- Dating apps, nightclubs, and bars are the worst places to find people. “Millet sevgilisini senle aldatti oyle ortamlarda amk”
- To attract high-quality women to become high-quality men
    - 1 - Have your own introspectiveness
    - 2 - Have red and green flags
    - 3 - What does my ideal girl want
- The red pill just pushes you to become avoidant. Just learn about seduction, psychology, and gentlemen, there are feminine men (loud, arrogant, hate) trash attracts trash. Casual sex is the fast food of love.
- If you want a feminine woman you need to become masculine. They don't need another femininity, understand your role in relationships. They will all want you to be feminine. Be more authentic about your masculinity don't act macho. It is okay to have feminine traits.
- Have a standard for yourself. Have green flags.
- Take your time to evaluate the flags. Here are some good green flags:
    - Father relationship.
    - Her parents are still married (healthy)
    - Her mother is a milf.
    - A kind person is rude and gossips.
    - None or limited casual sex relationships.
    - Has high-quality friends (bad ones are a threat you become friends with who you are)
- Focus only on hitting 6 of these milestones and you will see women enter naturally. Don't chase, attract: (10% man)
    - 1 - Gym, muscle
    - 2 - Style, Grooming
    - 3 - Business, Career (10k income)
    - 4 - Vibrant social circle
    - 5 - Confidence (read books on this)
    - 6 - Mental Health (anxiety, depression)
    - 7 - Game, red pill fundamentals (kino .. etc.) (don't become a degenerate)
    - 8 - Understanding masculine - feminine energy
    - 9 - (optional) - clout and fame
- Adonis focuses on himself, women focus on him, and cucks focus on women. Chose where you want to be.
- Casual sex is bad you just use someone else's body while not even liking them or them not liking you much. All of the wasted time, is this worth it?
- Just because you want green flags you shouldn't be a degenerate, be a gentleman, a good man, not a loser or a bad boy and them having red flags does not make them a bad person, just you guys not being compatible.
- You do not have to date if you think you are not focused on yourself. Build your castle and let them come in. First, learn how to love by being secure. But date people. Just don't think every girlfriend is your special diamond. If you are not serious about commitment to them display that with honesty, authenticity, and gentlemanly character.
- Green flags also have a socio-economical niche that you would like.  For example, I don't want to date villagers. Maybe my perception will change. I do not know.
- Don't be the weird 30-year-old money guy with no dating practice, have one day dedicated to it every week.
- Relationship Mistakes
    - #1 → Onetis
    - #2 → Cold/Distant
    - #3 → Controlling
    - #4 → Ignoring foundation red flags (don't save people)
    - #5 → slipping on self-improvement, goals
- For the cold approach - use the day game → cold approach success = approach instantly. (first 100 approaches will be trash know that so get them out of your sys) it is even ok for stuttering.  Have the habit of instantly speaking)
- Don't be a nice guy or red pill degenerate, be a good guy that does not take disrespect.
- Hire friends and partners slowly and fire quickly.
- Be scarce, don’t be on all dating apps. Fuck these apps. If you weren't a loser you would not be using dating apps. Fix your desperation.
- Ambition is the most exciting thing for a woman. Physical attractiveness gets you through the door. Ambition is shown with storytelling.
- Stick or Twist - cashing out early - when you just start making little money and going little to the gym. Boom, serious relationship - mortgage - marriage - kids. Delay the reward for later. Cashing out early makes you average. Pair bonding is a real thing. If you have a kid with the wrong person think about how much negativity the kid will feel toward you.
- Your daughter will date a man like you. It takes a lot of self-improvement to work on your attachment style. Fuck being a DA. Leave the degenerate woman to degenerate men.
- When you think that “I hope that bitch doesn’t get pregnant” and you are with a woman just for fucking. Think about who you have become. Selim-Jefferey. Think about the times you were fatherless. Be the father from today without even meeting a new woman.
- When you become high quality you will find fewer women but the quality will be up. However, you need a new location rather than tinder or nightclubs. You meet women outside and in your own new high-value lifestyle.
- Never get complacent in a relationship.
- The main high value comes from characteristics and values.
- The woman you date is a reflection of yourself.
- The last 3 women, think about them, if they were low quality, you are too, if they are not well done. (the three woman does not have to be your girlfriend, they can even be a. crush on them. Be 100% honest)
- Women don't know they are testing you. 5% in her always wants to reassure them that you are the man she wants to have a kid with even if she is 90 years old. We are attracted to the initial person and hope they will be better in the future.
- If they are rude to retail workers they are the biggest asshole. It is one of my own largest red flags.
- The best woman will ruthlessly test you. It is natural and a good thing. Even with small things when you are on a diet and she wants ice cream and she will unconsciously test to see if you are disciplined. You need to show discipline in your values. Dating hasn't changed from 1000 years ago our brains haven't evolved much. Women just test and want the strongest disciplined male for their children.
- There are so many hyper-competitive guys that they are driving this deviation between hypergamy.
- When you have insecure thoughts about your relationship (trust issues) tell her truthfully and work it together to be stronger couple. Insecure people with attract eachother anyway so why stress yourself too much about other insecurely attached peoples behaviours?
- Dont look at woman as they are a insta-hub objects. Look at them as people with sad history.
- You wont be with a anastasia if you dont plan on getting married, you will just attract jessicas.
- Being a slut doesnt have a gender, jessicas and jefferies both of them are sluts.
- Think about a wife to have children with and become the man she will be attracted to.
- They say only 1% of marrigest last? Strive to be in that 1% dont be normal.
- Don’t be afraid to want a beautiful woman. It is not vain to do this.
- Best man are not incels or degenerates badboys. They are intellectual chads.
- Single best green flag → She is on positive growth trajectory.
- Relationship is not a friendship, of course there is friendship element o it but you are together to grow a family not a chummy chummy friendship.
- Even though you are in casual dating sometimes, find people that you like and share night with. Dont settle even in pleasure. Because sex is a bonding experience even if you dont want to commit to that person.
- Make a woman your girlfriend if you think she has a potential to be mother to your children.
- Anxious people are worse actually. Even though they want love the most, they dont know how to love and they are egotistical. They are really stuck and child like when it comes to love. As worse as avoidants to be honest.
- If it is casual dont make it serious your emotion will be connected of course but deep journal!
- Be masculine in relationships, be the leader, make the decisions, time freedom, location freedom, financial freedom.

- About Rejection:
    - it simply means you are not compatible move on to the next one. 
    - Be humbled, dont move down your standards, have faith in self improvement until what you want chases you, as a man you biologically don't have the option to chase.
- Understanding partners attachment style:
    - Ask them about their relationship with their opposite gender parent (or same gender, if they're gay).
    - If they say it's great, but can't give any specific details, they're avoidant.
    - If they talk about how much of a struggle it is, and how they can't be understood and have to lie, anxious.
    - If they say their same gender partner is their best friend and they talk about everything, also probably anxious.
    - If they have cut off the relationship completely, it's a sign of severe avoidant trauma (but it could also be a step towards learned secure for an anxious/FA person).
    - If they have a good relationship with regular communication (1+ times a week), but also aren't relying on their parents for everything, secure.
