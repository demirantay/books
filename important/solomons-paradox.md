# Solomons Paradox

`Idea`: We can see solutions to other people's problems more clearly than to our own. So you would give yourself better advive if you did not know you were giving the advice to yourself. 

  Basically, you have the wisdom in you but when you are trying to get advice for yourself your emotional self is in control.

[here is the psychological explanation if you want more research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9377507/#:~:text=Solomon's%20paradox%20of%20wise%20reasoning,underlying%20psychological%20mechanism%20remains%20unclear.)

`Practical Usage`: open a file/notebook and write questions as your current self. But try to give advice on the answering part by imagining yourself you are 50 yearl old you and wiser.
