## 🦹 Part X

> To be aware of the supervillain in your head.

“Part X is the judgmental part of you. The voice of impossibility. An invisible force that wants to keep you from changing or growing.” “You can’t get rid of it. You can defeat it temporarily but it is going to keep coming back. If you could banish Part X, there would be no further progress.”


## 😱 Aspects of Reality

> To see opportunity in adversity.

“Nobody gets to avoid the three aspects of reality.”

`Pain, Uncertianty, Constant Work`

“Pain will never go away.

Uncertainty will never go away.

There’s no getting away from the need for constant work.”
