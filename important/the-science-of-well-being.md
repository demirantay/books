# The Science of Well Being

### Week 1

- Become happier by applying practical psychology.
- What we will learn:
    - Misconceptions about happiness.
    - Why our expectations are so bad.
    - What stuff really increases happiness.
    - Strategies to reset our expectations.
    - Putting strategies into practice.
- G.I. Joe Fallacy - knowing stuff is not enough for a change. For example, knowing that you are an avoidant won't solve a thing. It is only 20 percent of the battle.
    
    Instead, use “vision”.
    
    Just like professors and psychologists are as mopy as a patient. They fall, victim to this fallacy, a lot.
- My strengths as a person:
    - Appreciation
    - Bravery
    - Perspective
    - Love of learning
    - love
    - leadership
    - humor
    - humility
    - honesty
    - curiosity
    - creative
 
 ### Week 2
 
 - Things we think will make us happy but don't:
    - A good job: A good job does not bring you happiness, your happiness caps out after $10k a month.
    - Materialism and consumerism actually make us more unhappy. Instead chose freedom and purpose.
    - Even in marriage → First two honeymoon phases are extremely happy. Even true love is like focusing too much on materialism just like focusing on BMW or G-wagon. In itself, it does not bring true happiness.
- Having the perfect body with 11% body fat with veiny abs will not make you happy.
- Annoying features of the mind:
    - Genetics play (50%) of your unhappiness.
    - Life Trauma (10%) of your unhappiness.
    - Actions/Thoughts (40%) of your unhappiness (you can control this!)
- You don't have to be 100% happy. Just you can work to achieve 60% - 70% percent which is more than enough. Life is not black and white, you can live with this.
- You cannot trust your lizard brain which tells you a Mercedes g wagon will make you extremely happy. Life and your 40% happiness should be designed and your priority.
 
 ### Week 3
 
 - Annoying features of the mind (these are all annoying and can/should be changed)
    - Feature #1 - Mis-wanting → the act of being mistaken about what and how much you will like something in the future.
    - Feature #2 - Our minds don't think of in absolutes, they think in reference points. The simple meaning is we are always comparing and judging something based on previous experiences.
    - Feature #3 - Our minds are built to get used to stuff, this is called “perceptual adaptation”
    - Feature #4 - We don’t realize that our minds are built to get used to stuff.
 
 
 ### Week 4
 
 - We think these things make a good job and make us happy: lots of money, awesome stuff, true love, the perfect body, the perfect grades → These things don't really make us happy.
- Strategies to use intentionally to overcome your biases:
    - 1# → Don't invest in stuff, invest in experiences “a Ferrari sticks around to disappoint you but a trip to Europe goes away with a wonderful memory”.
    - 2# → Savoring → Look for people to share it, and share it with other people after the experience ends. Try to be present and absorbed.
        Things that hurt savoring → Focusing on the future, reminding yourself it would be over soon, comparing it to others.
    - 3# → Negative Visualization → Take a minute to write how you might never meet your partner, not become the man you became, and never had your laptop to learn to code.
    - 4# → MAke this day your last → think about the feelings you would show if it was your last day. Like Sahir, you will die in a hospital bed one day.
    - 5# → Gratitude → write down 5 things you are grateful for.
- Reset your reference points:
    - 1# → concretely re-experience - re-experience the bad thing and compare it to your current situation.
    - 2# → concretely observe - concretely try to see how good or bad your self is in the situation.
    - 3# → Avoid Social Comparisons
    - 4# → Interrupt your consumption → if you can force yourself to stop your reference point. Once you do this pausing and returning back, improves your experience and happiness.
    - 5# → Increase your variety → Have a variety of things in your life. Have a lot of 7s across the board. Just focusing on a single 10 will not make you happy. But 7s all across will.
    
 
 ### Week 5

- Meditation and gratitude/journaling is a must.
- Stuff that makes us happy. We need to want the right parts of what we already want.
    - Good Job → 2 factors to look for:
        - 1) find a job with your signature strengths (24 character strengths) (4 is the sweet spot)
        - 2) Flow, the mental state in which a person performs the activity in a fully energized and immersed feeling. The best way to achieve flow is for your skills are being tested at a max challenge.
    - Growth Mindset → Intelligence and problem-solving can be trained and all of your skills can be advanced. a growth mindset focuses on learning and input rather than a fixed mindset which focuses on results and outcomes like the things they cannot really control.
- The better stuff we don't want but should:
    - 1# Kindness → Combining kindness with external things brings a lot of happiness. For example, if you earn money combine it with a kind action. Buy your brother something etc. (Sending gratitude messages to your loved ones)
    - 2# Social Connection → Just being around other people improves our happiness a lot!
- Time affluence → Value time over money prioritizing getting more extra time makes you happier.
- Meditate to stop-mind your wandering. It is extremely important and it makes you happier, and grows the gray matter in your brain.
- Healthy Practices → Exercise, Sleep (!this is so important to have for your mental health. Never miss it!)
 
 
 ### Week 6
 
 - Situation Support → basically if you change your environment it helps you, for example, has notes and reminders, checklists on your computers, do not buy soda into your house .etc.
- Goal Settings →
    - 1 - goal specify
    - 2 - goal visualization
    - 3 - goal planning
    - 4 - potential obstacles
    
     ask yourself what you want today, month, year,10 years your life should have a purpose.
