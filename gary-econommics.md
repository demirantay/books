- Korona zamaninda 2020’de ekonomiye basilan paralar, parayi degersizlestirdi ve nakit aksinin nerdeyse hepsi zenginlere gitti, the rich won’t spend on items they will just buy assets. Creating inequality and austeriy.
    
    (this matters because, in 2002 the same thing happenede, and all asset prices increased, young people couldn’t afford homes anymore called from 70% to 30%. It usually follows the same pareot principle, 80-20, 90-10). It becomes impossible to buy housing. No security.
    

- When gary says taxing the rich he doesn’t mean working man who are doctors, lawyers, engineers, he means old families that accumulate wealth for 6-8 generations. 100m-1B that don’t get their income through their work.

- If we don’t fix the inequality, we won’t have a recovered economy. It is that simple, the cycle is broken. Rich > Salaries of Workers > Rent, Utilities > Rich. The government just gave everything to the rich. the rich always saves.

- What is wealth? ordinary people think money is work-job, wealth is not job. Wealth is about what do you own. Shops, Banks, Houses, Skycrapers, Bars, Restaurants, Even Debt is owned by the wealth which is in the rich people, they are all owned. 

They get the money from people through rent. The gas electricity you use, goes to the the owners, when you buy supermarket food, 80% of it goes to the owners, supermarkets make 1-3% profits ornegative because of subsidies.

When the economy doesn't grow in a sense, they have to spend that passive income, they just buy your moms house, there is no way around it. 

And when they take the asset prices from our hands, they raise the asset prices, so no one will ever get them essentially, because they don’t want to sell but there is a huge demand. 

So it is either revolution, thievery, or self creation to get stuff.  (usually houses) — but also you can sell luxury items because the tich become narcisstic which start their downfall.

- Governments money printing at 2020’s pandemic time will affect us for the foreseeable 10-20 years, it is not a matter of inflation or GDP or stock prices. They just gave the keys. 10-20 years. In 10-20 years getting a property (house) will be IMPOSSIBLE if inequality undealt with.

- Online Trading is basically a casino, do not enter. Since it will worsen with each generation, the kids will turn into gambling, crime, fraud. Nothing else.

- No matter which part of the world you are from, top jobs go to the richest kids. It is just a bubble. Nothing else. A segregated-gated group. They get chosen by family and class not metiocracy. That just breeds idicoy and incompetence. Thats why politics just became so incompetent at all aroudns of the world.

- Financial freedom is possible, if you know what you are doing, focusing on it too much will not make you free, it will make you the sale of that money. You should have a healthy relationship with money.

- What Happens when you fix inequality → You cannot have a system where only 5% percent own the wealth of 95%. You will always have rich people, they are the hardworkers, its biology. But the system should provide mobility for ordinary people. maybe 20-30 % owning 70-80%. If you do not have money to go around in ordinary folk and social class mobility, the system will be bottle-locked and stressed.

- Why housing is so expensive → It is not just housing all assets prices have risen since 2008, (house, land, gold, .etc.) 

as wealth inequality rises, you see a fall in the prices of wages, goods and services. and increase in the prices of assets (Stocks, shares, land, gold, housing)

the reason you don’t see your wages down because central banks keep printing money (it is effectively making it worthless even if your number goes from 500$ to 1000$ you immediately see an improvement but longterm you are poorer. 

Thats why wages stay the same, but asset prices go through the roof, making you essentially poorer. 

Housing is gonna get much more expensive in the years ahead int he world just like turkey. 

And during retirement poor ones need to sell the houses to pay for retirement since wages are not even keeping up with food, and rent so the rich gets get the houses even more because of their passive incomes.

- National insurance, Tax. → first of all national insurance (like sigorta is just a tax with a different name so that you don’t revlot nothing else. just like income tax.

Politicans will not raise the taxes at the moment because they are the ones who own the properties or they are being run by people who own the assets.

- Basics of Investing (you can easily get 3%-5% return on your assets. That is the normal.
    
    You don’t have to gamble on crypto or trading just to make money. You have to be really well educated to succeed and even still it is fucking gambling. Gambling with peoples pain. Especially those grusu.
    Keep to the basics even if economy is extremely unequal like 1=99%. Serve the rich. Invest that serving in assets. 80/20 = 80% stable assets, 20% risky assets. 
    3-5% return is BEST no need for 10%-20% that is a bit much. 
    
    Don’t be dragged into crypto and trading, or big stocks like tesla.
    
    First thing you should get is a property.
    
- Basics of Investing → Really AVOID having large sums of savings in cash. this is foe 10-20k think about that for a second. It is even that low.
    
    invest in stocks and shares, invest in gold/silver, invest in property-land (basics mate). Stocks tend to do well if the economy is good. Gold tend to do bad if you are an economic pessimist. Mixture of both is very good. 
    
    Everytime you buy an asset there is a risk involved, the value can fluactate, but when you think longterm they are always better than cash which is just a paper. 
    

- Government Debt → That is not a debt to no body. That is a debt to the rich they own that debt.

- Why are economists always wrong → they are stuck in loops of the old king era and from rich families that cannot comprehend, everybody else in the TV is just an entertainer and wants to be a clown for the sponsors :) fear mongering fools. Economy is in the street not in the elite people teaching math equations in old castles at oxford. Education is not education it is just for elites at the moment. Real comprehension is either don't he internet or the street.

- Nearly all newspapers, like bloomers … etc. They all say things like (we are low on productivity) they are not gonna push any message that says and talks about wealth inequality.
    
    
    Most of the ideas you get from those papers, channels like Bloomberg saying you need to cut down on Starbucks coffee is that, they want you to be distracted. 
    

- Mainstream media has no idea, what is causing this inflation. They are talking about it like it is some form of natural disaster. Instead of taxing the inequality, they are gonna raise the interest rates. It means people who has debt will pay more to people with savings, we already have 80% debts on the bottom 80% so the rich will even get more richer with interest rates, it will not lower inflation.

Just because the interest rates and inflation will come back to normal, will not mean the inequality has been fixed. Covid and extreme amount of printing already happened we are already at 90-10 percentages in nearly all countries. The higher costs will stay permanent.

- Social Mobility and Homelessness → homelessness on the street is the tip of the iceberg, everyone is homeless nearly. They are living with friends, cars, bouncing from one family member to the next. No one can afford a home. One step above that is people struggling make the rent, and one paycheck away from homelessness.

- If you wanna measure just check on if the party reduced inequality. If they didn’t it doesn’t mean anything. Drugs, immigration … ffs. But this is in terms of economics. Follow the money.

- Crypto → all of these investments are completely risky. you can possibly lose all the money you invest in them. Gambling addicts are just doing trading/crypto now and that is about it. 

Decentralised finance is the way forward in the magicians age, but the market right now is just for gambling addicts. Ofc you can earn money. keep 20% risk investments in your portfolio. But follow the assets. Assets are real wealth. Fucking brick houses, sheep, house.

Just because right now money/cash is a bad investment that does not mean you should YOLO and gamble your money on internet, decantrilized is the way but not this way. Buy a fucking gold or some shit. 

- Covid → Biggest economic disaster happened since the great depression. Cost of Living crisis == Ineqaulity crisis.

- Why Energy Price Rises Punish the Poor & Reward the Rich → This is about hoarding as well. Energy tax is a tax on the poorest of society.

- There is a consensus that, the globally economy is fucked forever after 2008 and Covid. Financial markets have already accepted it, its just Media did not accepted it.

- Post Covid Economy if we don’t fix inequality → If we do not take action, things are gonna be extremely badly for ordinary people. The media and politicians ignore the massive asset accumulation of the rich > Rich are gonna buy assets and push up the prices of the resources, (not just food, house also energy, water .etc.) > Richer families (kids) are gonna buy the properties of poor families > Ordinary families will have nothing >  Rich will have everything > This will affect the economy for 10-20 years.

- **Why Rich People Get Richer -**
    
    Vast majority of wealth and assets are owned by the rich people, those assets are often what normal people live in, and it needs a rent for the wealth. If 95% of your salary goes to the rich people, it makes fucking sense that they just get richer and richer by the system. 
    
    Rich people live live luxurious lives, so that is one way that the money flows back. but if they get richer and richer back. only certain people are left, they cannot take that many holidays.
